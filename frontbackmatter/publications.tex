\chapter{Parts of this Thesis and Author Contributions}
\label{ch:author-contributions}

% TODO: Number of peer-reviewed publication
This cumulative dissertation includes five scientific publications of which four are peer-reviewed and one is a preprint currently under review. In addition, I contributed to two peer-reviewed papers and one non-peer-reviewed article related to microplastics research which are not part of this thesis.

The experiments were conducted at the iES Landau, Institute for Environmental Sciences, at University of Koblenz--Landau. My contribution to the scientific work is detailed below.

	\item[Author contributions:] The conceptualization and preliminary literature research for this review started in the framework of an elective master course at University of Koblenz--Landau. Beyond that, Z.~Steinmetz took the lead in writing and finalizing the manuscript for publication. Z.~Steinmetz prepared Sections~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:intro} and \ref{sec:plastic-mulching:methods}, parts of Section~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:fate}, as well as Sections~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:soil-quality} and \ref{sec:plastic-mulching:conclusions}. C.~Wollmann contributed Section~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:use-and-properties} and parts of Section \ref{sec:plastic-mulching:fate}. M.~Schaefer and J.~Tröger wrote Section~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:agronomic-implications}. C.~Buchmann, J.~David, K.~Muñoz, O.~Frör, and G.~E.~Schaumann supervised the project. All authors gave approval to the final version of the manuscript.

	\item[Author contributions:] D.~Thomas and B.~Schütze conducted the literature research and wrote Sections~\ref{sec:analytical-techniques:sampling} to \ref{sec:analytical-techniques:som-removal}. W.~M.~Heinze contributed to all sections with particular emphasis on Sections~\ref{sec:analytical-techniques:sample-prep} and \ref{sec:analytical-techniques:suggestions}. Z.~Steinmetz wrote Sections~\ref{sec:analytical-techniques:intro}, \ref{sec:analytical-techniques:solvent-extraction}, \ref{sec:analytical-techniques:recent-developments}, \ref{sec:analytical-techniques:analysis}, and \ref{sec:analytical-techniques:suggestions}, finalized the manuscript, and supervised the project. D.~Thomas plans to equally use this publication for her dissertation thesis.
