\chapter{Parts of this Thesis and Author Contributions}
\label{ch:author-contributions}

This cumulative dissertation includes five chapters which have been published in similar form as peer-reviewed research papers.
In detail, Chapters~\ref{ch:plastic-mulching}--\ref{ch:screening} are based on the respective accepted manuscripts without subsequent formatting by the publishing journal.
Upon incorporation of the manuscripts into this dissertation, the wording was aligned across chapters, repetitions were removed or shortened, and spelling mistakes were corrected. Furthermore, all figures were redesigned to fit in size, font, and color schemes.

The research was conducted at the iES Landau, Institute for Environmental Sciences, at University of Koblenz--Landau. Financial support was provided by the pilot program ``Profil\textsuperscript{3}'' of the ``\foreignlanguage{ngerman}{Bildung Mensch Umwelt}'' research fund at the University of Koblenz--Landau (project ``PLAST'') and by the Ministry for Education, Science, Further Education and Culture (MBWWK) of Rhineland-Palatinate in the frame of the Interdisciplinary Research Group for Environmental Studies (\foreignlanguage{ngerman}{IFG Umwelt}) of the University of Koblenz--Landau.

My contribution to the scientific work is detailed below.

	\item[Author contributions:] The conceptualization and preliminary literature research for this review started in the framework of an elective master course at University of Koblenz--Landau. Beyond that, Z.~Steinmetz took the lead in writing and finalizing the manuscript for publication. Z.~Steinmetz prepared Sections~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:intro} and \ref{sec:plastic-mulching:methods}, parts of Section~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:fate}, as well as Sections~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:soil-quality} and \ref{sec:plastic-mulching:conclusions}. C.~Wollmann contributed Section~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:use-and-properties} and parts of Section \ref{sec:plastic-mulching:fate}. M.~Schaefer and J.~Tröger wrote Section~\ref{sec:plastic-mulching:agronomic-implications}. C.~Buchmann, J.~David, K.~Muñoz, O.~Frör, and G.~E.~Schaumann supervised the project. All authors gave approval to the final version of the manuscript.
