  abstract = {This study aimed to (1) investigate microrubbers (MRs) for the first time and identify microplastics (MPs) in street dust, (2) determine the physicochemical and mineralogical characteristics and morphology of dust particles, (3) understand the concentration and the possible source(s) of heavy metals/metalloids, (4) identify the chemical speciation and mobility potential of trace metals in urban street dusts, and (5) determine adverse health effects of street dust on children and adults living in the city of Bushehr in southwestern Iran. Generally, twenty four street dust samples were collected and analyzed. Calculated enrichment factors indicate high levels of contamination. Statistical analysis reveals that the two main sources of trace elements include road traffic emissions (Cu, Zn, Sb, Hg, Pb, Mo) and re-suspended soil particles (Al, Mn, Ni, Ti, Cd, Co). BCR sequential extraction results indicated that As, Zn, Cu, and Pb mainly occur in the exchangeable fraction and hence are highly bioavailable. X-ray powder diffraction analysis revealed the presence of calcite, dolomite, quartz, and magnetite. The size distribution of dust particles was also investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), while elemental distribution was analyzed using an attached energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM–EDS) unit. Dust particles from heavy traffic areas are much finer compared with other investigated areas. MPs and MRs, mostly fibers and fragments, were detected in all samples [ranging from 210 to 1658 (MPs) and 44 to 782 (MRs) items/10 g dust] using fluorescence microscopy. The hazard index for As is higher than 10−4 for children and adults indicative of high risk. According to the calculated potential ecological risk index, Hg indicated moderate ecological risk in the street dust of the study area.},

  abstract = {The assessment of water quality is crucial for safeguarding drinking water resources and ecosystem integrity. To this end, sample preparation and extraction is critically important, especially when investigating emerging contaminants and the toxicity of water samples. As extraction methods are rarely optimised for bioassays but rather adopted from chemical analysis, this may result in a misrepresentation of the actual toxicity. In this study, surface water, groundwater, hospital and municipal wastewater were used to characterise the impacts of common sample preparation techniques (acidification, filtration and solid phase extraction (SPE)) on the outcomes of eleven in vitro bioassays. The latter covered endocrine activity (reporter gene assays for estrogen, androgen, aryl-hydrocarbon, retinoic acid, retinoid X, vitamin D, thyroid receptor), mutagenicity (Ames fluctuation test), genotoxicity (umu test) and cytotoxicity. Water samples extracted using different SPE sorbents (Oasis HLB, Supelco ENVI-Carb+, Telos C18/ENV) at acidic and neutral pH were compared for their performance in recovering biological effects. Acidification, commonly used for stabilisation, significantly altered the endocrine activity and toxicity of most (waste)water samples. Sample filtration did not affect the majority of endpoints but in certain cases affected the (anti-)estrogenic and dioxin-like activities. SPE extracts (10.4× final concentration), including WWTP effluents, induced significant endocrine effects that were not detected in aqueous samples (0.63× final concentration), such as estrogenic, (anti-)androgenic and dioxin-like activities. When ranking the SPE methods using multivariate Pareto optimisation an extraction with Telos C18/ENV at pH 7 was most effective in recovering toxicity. At the same time, these extracts were highly cytotoxic masking the endpoint under investigation. Compared to that, extraction at pH 2.5 enriched less cytotoxicity. In summary, our study demonstrates that sample preparation and extraction critically affect the outcome of bioassays when assessing the toxicity of water samples. Depending on the water matrix and the bioassay, these methods need to be optimised to accurately assess water quality.},

Mixed reagents of diphenylcarbazide and 1,10-phenanthroline in a non-ionic micellar solution of Triton X-100 was used as a selective chromogenic system for determination of Cr(VI) and Fe(III). The presence of a micellar system allows one to eliminate the previous solvent extraction step that is necessary for the determination of slightly soluble metal complexes in the absence of micelles. This reduces the cost and toxicity of the method. The total relative standard error for applying the PLS method to 15 synthetic samples in the ranges 0.20–6.00μgml−1 Cr(VI) and 0.20–8.00μgml−1 was 1.5\%. The results of applying the H-point standard addition method showed that Cr(VI) and Fe(III) can be determined simultaneously with weight concentration ratios of Cr(VI) to Fe(III) varying from 15:1 to 1:30 in the mixed sample. Both proposed methods (PLS and HPSAM) were also successfully applied to the determination of Cr and Fe in several synthetic alloy solutions.},

  abstract = {Organic crop production, whether for export or local consumption, is increasing to avoid the residual effects of synthetic herbicides in foods, soil, and water, toxicity to other nontarget organisms, and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Organic farmers consistently ranked weed management as one of their most important production problems. Therefore, a 2-year study was conducted under 15-year-old mandarin trees to compare the effects of rice straw mulch, cattail mulch, black plastic mulch, hand hoeing, cultivation, glyphosate, and unweeded control treatments on weed control, fruit yield, and fruit quality. The greatest control (94\%-100\%) of weeds occurred with the plastic mulch (200 or 150 pm) and three mulch layers of rice straw or cattail. Covering soil with cattail or rice straw mulch (two layers) gave 85\% to 98\% control of weeds. Uncontrolled weeds in the weedy control caused significant reduction in yield and fruit quality and decreased the yield/tree by 62\% compared with hand hoe treatment. Plastic mulches of 200 and 150 mu m, cattail (Cyprus articulatus L.) mulch (two or three layers) and two mulch layers of rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw treatments significantly increased the fruit yield/tree by 24\%, 18\%, 20\%, 11\%, and 12\% more than cultivation treatment, respectively, without significant differences among these superior treatments. Soil mulching with three layers of rice straw, cultivation, glyphosate, and 80-mu m plastic mulch treatments caused a significant reduction in weed density and weed biomass, but gave lower yield than superior treatments. Total soluble solids of fruits was unaffected by any of the weed management strategies, whereas values of total acidity and vitamin C were significantly lower in the unwedded control than most weeded treatments. These results demonstrate that two layers of cattail or rice straw mulch could be used effectively for controlling weeds in citrus groves. Their effectiveness in controlling weeds may increase their use in agriculture systems with a concomitant decrease in the need for synthetic herbicides. Further studies are needed to evaluate their side effects on beneficial organisms, diseases, and insects.},

The recovery of polymer in every case was greater than 90\%. FT-IR spectra and tensile mechanical properties of the samples before and after recycling were measured. Furthermore, catalytic pyrolysis was carried out in a laboratory fixed bed reactor with an FCC catalyst using again model polymers and waste products as raw materials. Analysis of the derived gases and oils showed that pyrolysis gave a mainly aliphatic composition consisting of a series of hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes), with a great potential to be recycled back into the petrochemical industry as a feedstock for the production of new plastics or refined fuels.},

  abstract = {Plastic mulch films are widely used in agriculture to enhance crop production by suppressing weeds, conserving soil water and increasing soil temperature. The majority of plastic mulch films are however not biodegradable and are typically removed after each growing season. Recovery of these plastics from the soil is difficult and can affect successive crop yields while causing substantive cost to the environment and farmers. Due to increasingly stringent regulations regarding use of non-degradable plastic in agriculture they are likely to be phased out in the near future. In the past 10 years several classes of ‘biodegradable’ materials have been studied but most of these films are reported to be relatively weak in mechanical properties, not efficiently degradable and cost prohibitive. More recently, researchers have turned their attention to sprayable biodegradable polymer coatings for use on soils due to their easy application and versatility. The ability to mix natural additives, plasticizers and fillers to control and improve the mechanical and biodegradation properties of the core polymeric mulch film has been the driving force behind the development of these next generation sprayable polymeric mulch films. There have been many excellent review articles and papers written about polymeric mulch film, but the developing sprayable polymer systems have not been reviewed to the same extent. This paper focusses on the research progress in the area of biodegradable and sprayable polymer mulch film with emphasis on polymer formulations, properties and application. It also discusses current research to highlight the importance, potential benefits and future challenges in developing a cost effective biodegradable sprayable film for use in production agriculture.},

Experiments with soil solarization showed a pronounced reduction in weed population soon after removal of the transparent polyethylene sheets. Solarization controlled weeds (98.5\%), increased soil temperature by 11.5oC over non-solarized soil at 10 cm depth, reduced soil-borne pests, reduced ear rot diseases (72.5\%), conserved moisture, increased the availability of essential nutrients in the soil and hence enhanced the growth of corn plants. Soil solarization was found an effective method in controlling ear rots. In treated plots, grain yield was more than double due to pathogen control, enhanced available nutrients in the soil as well as no competition with weeds. Soil solarization applied with transparent polyethylene film was found the most effective in reducing the incidence of corn ear rots and consequently reduced mycotoxins (fumonisins and aflatoxins) in fields and stored corn. We can avoid the hazardous/ poisonous effects of different chemicals on plant and animal life and thus, soil solarization technology could be used for the management of mycotoxins in food grains in future.},

  abstract = {Background and AimsAlthough maize roots have been extensively studied, there is limited information on the effect of root exudates on the hydraulic properties of maize rhizosphere. Recent experiments suggested that the mucilaginous fraction of root exudates may cause water repellency of the rhizosphere. Our objectives were: 1) to investigate whether maize rhizosphere turns hydrophobic after drying and subsequent rewetting; 2) to test whether maize mucilage is hydrophobic; and 3) to find a quantitative relation between rhizosphere rewetting, particle size, soil matric potential and mucilage concentration.MethodsMaize plants were grown in aluminum containers filled with a sandy soil. When the plants were 3-weeks-old, the soil was let dry and then it was irrigated. The soil water content during irrigation was imaged using neutron radiography. In a parallel experiment, ten maize plants were grown in sandy soil for 5 weeks. Mucilage was collected from young brace roots growing above the soil. Mucilage was placed on glass slides and let dry. The contact angle was measured with the sessile drop method for varying mucilage concentration. Additionally, capillary rise experiments were performed in soils of varying particle size mixed with maize mucilage. We then used a pore-network model in which mucilage was randomly distributed in a cubic lattice. The general idea was that rewetting of a pore is impeded when the concentration of mucilage on the pore surface (g cm−2) is higher than a given threshold value. The threshold value depended on soil matric potential, pore radius and contract angle. Then, we randomly distributed mucilage in the pore network and we calculated the percolation of water across a cubic lattice for varying soil particle size, mucilage concentration and matric potential.ResultsOur results showed that: 1) the rhizosphere of maize stayed temporarily dry after irrigation; 2) mucilage became water repellent after drying. Mucilage contact angle increased with mucilage surface concentration (gram of dry mucilage per surface area); 3) Water could easily cross the rhizosphere when the mucilage concentration was below a given threshold. In contrast, above a critical mucilage concentration water could not flow through the rhizosphere. The critical mucilage concentration decreased with increasing particle size and decreasing matric potential.ConclusionsThese results show the importance of mucilage exudation for the water fluxes across the root-soil interface. Our percolation model predicts at what mucilage concentration the rhizosphere turns hydrophobic depending on soil texture and matric potential. Further studies are needed to extend these results to varying soil conditions and to upscale them to the entire root system.},

  abstract = {The omnipresent character of microplastics (MPs) in environmental matrices, organisms and products has recently posed the need of their qualitative as well as quantitative analysis imperative, in order to provide data about their abundance and specification of polymer types in several substrates. In this framework, current and emerging approaches based on the chromatographic separation are of increased relevance in the field of MPs analysis and possess a large number of merits, since most of them are applicable in various complex matrices, sensitive and ideal for the detection of small-sized particles, whereas the common absence of any special pre-treatment step before analysis should also be highlighted. Αnalytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) has recently gained ground as a powerful means to deliver information on MPs composition and degradation after their release into environment. Several instrumentations and trends in the area of analytical pyrolysis are thoroughly described within this review, while newly-exploited chromatographic methods in the field of MPs analysis, including Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) in this line are also investigated. The present review fills the gap of standardization concerning sampling, pre-treatment and chromatographic approaches and gathers all the available methodologies applied inside this area in accordance with the studied substrate, with the most examined environmental matrices being the solid one. After investigating the various works, some development options arise and it appears that chromatographic approaches should focus on improved extraction processes in terms of MPs isolation, since it is a crucial part in plastic items monitoring and is commonly depended on the polymer type and matrix. Special attention is given on the potential of chromatographic techniques for microplastics identification as well as quantification by confirming the current research status and knowledge gaps and highlighting some of the recent trends in this field.},

The current review outlines the characteristics and the development of (multi-step) pyrolysis coupled with a gas chromatography mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) for the identification and semi-quantification of OPAs. Compared to traditional methods, Py-GC/MS offers advantages like suppressing extensive steps of preparation, limiting contamination due to solvents and the possibility to analyse minute particles. Its key advantage is the successive analysis of OPAs and the polymeric matrix of the same sample. Based on the studied articles, numerous methods have been described allowing identification and, in some case, semi-quantification of OPAs. There is nevertheless no gold standard method, especially given the huge diversity of OPAs and the risks of interferences with polymers or other additives, but, among other parameters, a consensus temperature seems to arise from studies. More broadly, this review also explores many aspects on the sample preparation like weight and size of particles and calibration strategies. After studying the various works, some development prospects emerge and it appears that methodological developments should focus on better characterizing the limits of the methods in order to consider which OPAs can be quantified and in which polymers this is feasible.},

  abstract = {Soil temperature under plastic cover is a function of incoming radiation and thermal characteristics of the mulching material and the soil. A field experiment was conducted at Fudhiliyah Agrometeorological research station to investigate how soil temperature is influenced by differ ent soil moisture content regimes during soil solarization. Two soils, sandy loam and silty clay loam, were brought to five volumetric moisture regimes (M1-M5). The moistened soils were mulched with 180-mum-thick transparent polyethylene. Measurements of hourly soil temperatures for depths of 0.00, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.30 m were recorded from 1 June to 30 September. The results showed that the maximum soil temperatures decreased with increasing soil moisture content. The relationship between the hourly rise in soil temperature and heat flux were significantly affected by soil moisture content. Moreover, soil solarization efficiency decreased with increasing moisture content. The higher temperatures in both soils under the M4 irrigation regime resulted in faster eradication of the pathogenic fungus, Fusarium oxysporum (sp. lycopersici).

Here, we describe a one-step polymerization method, allowing direct radiolabeling of a sulfonate end-capped nano-sized polystyrene (nPS; proposed as a model nanoplastic particle representing negatively charged nanoplastics). The method, which produces nanoplastics trackable in simulated environmental settings which have already been used to investigate the behavior of a nanoplastic in vivo in a bivalve mollusc, was developed, optimized and successfully applied to synthesis of 14C-labeled nPS of different sizes. In addition to a description of the method of synthesis, we describe the details for quantification, mass balance and recovery of the labelled particles from complex matrices offered by the radiolabelling approach. The radiolabeling approach described here, coupled to use of a highly sensitive autoradiographic method for monitoring nanoplastic body burden and distributions, may provide a valuable procedure for investigating the environmental pathways followed by negatively charged nanoplastics at low predicted environmental concentrations. Whether the behaviour of the synthetic nPS manufactured here, synthesised using a very common inititator, represents that of manufactured nPS found in the environment, remains to be seen.},

  abstract = {Groundwater is the primary source of drinking water for all the islands of Hawaii. Past agricultural practices have led to the contamination of groundwater in certain locations. As a result, the state of Hawaii emphasizes the prevention of contamination of groundwater from the leaching of pesticides. Hawaii currently uses a simple ( Tier I) screening assessment model to evaluate the leaching potential of pesticides. This model is only capable of indicating if a chemical is likely to leach; it can estimate neither the concentration profile in soil nor the concentration in leachate water. The USEPA is seeking partnership with the state of Hawaii for examining the feasibility of using Tier II models in Hawaii conditions for pesticide registration. Two pesticide leaching models, MACRO 4.3 and S1D DUAL, were tested using leaching data for five pesticides from a field site on the island of Oahu. Despite deficiencies, it is one of the best data sets currently available for tropical soils. Both MACRO 4.3 and S1D DUAL models explicitly include preferential flow components but use different concepts in model formulations. The performances of the two models were generally similar. The results show that preferential flow had a minor role in transporting the chemicals compared with micropore flow because of the high saturated conductivity of micropores ( matrix). We conclude that a process-based model will contribute substantially to the evaluation of chemical leaching risk and complement the Tier I model that currently is used for pesticide registration in Hawaii.},

Degraded LDPE films were examined by infra-red spectroscopy. The carbonyl peak increased with time in the abiotic environment and the oxidative degradation reported in our earlier works was confirmed. In the presence of a biotic atmosphere, however, this peak decreased. At the same time there was an increase in double bonds which was related to weight loss. An explanation of this behavior is presented as a proposed mechanism for the biodegradation of polyethylene. This mechanism is compared, on the one hand, with abiotic photooxidation, Norrish type I and II degradation, and, on the other, with the biotic paraffin degradation. Abiotic, as well as biotic, ester formation mechanisms are also presented. An ESR spectrum confirms the presence of radicals on the polyethylene samples. At the beginning of the degradation the main agents seem to be UV light and/or oxidizing agents. When carbonyl groups have been produced, these are attacked by microorganisms which degrade the shorter segments of polyethylene chains and form carbon dioxide and water as end products. There is a synergistic effect between photooxidative degradation and biodegradation. The biodegradation of polyethylene can be compared with the biodegradation of paraffin.},

MPs' presence and concentration in the air, soil, marine, and freshwater environments have been reported as a matter of priority in recent years. This review addresses the current knowledge of the main pathways of MPs in air, soil, and freshwater reservoirs in order to provide an integrated understanding of their behaviors in the continental environment. Therefore, MPs' occurrence (as particle counts), sources, and how their features as shape, size, polymer composition, and density could influence their transport and final sink were discussed. Wind resuspension and atmospheric fallout, groundwater migration, runoff from catchments, and water flow from rivers and effluents were pointed as the principal pathways. MPs' size, shape, polymer composition, and density interact with environmental variables as soil structure and composition, precipitation, wind, relative humidity, water temperature, and salinity. Sampling designs for MPs research should further consider soil characteristics, climate variability and extreme events, time lag and grasshopper effects, morphological and hydrological features of aquatic systems, and water currents, among others. Furthermore, long-term monitoring and lab experiments are still needed to understand MPs' behavior in the environment. This information will provide a unified understanding of the continental MPs pathways, including the key main findings, knowledge gaps, and future challenges to understand this emerging contaminant.},

Of recent concern is the degradation of plastics from macro- to micro- and even to nanosized particles smaller than 100 nm in size. At the nanoscale, plastics are difficult to detect and can be transported in air, soil, and water compartments. While the impact of plastic debris on marine and fresh waters and organisms has been studied, the loads, transformations, transport, and fate of plastics in terrestrial and subsurface environments are largely overlooked. In this Critical Review, we first present estimated loads of plastics in different environmental compartments. We also provide a critical review of the current knowledge vis-à-vis nanoplastic (NP) and microplastic (MP) aggregation, deposition, and contaminant cotransport in the environment. Important factors that affect aggregation and deposition in natural subsurface environments are identified and critically analyzed. Factors affecting contaminant sorption onto plastic debris are discussed, and we show how polyethylene generally exhibits a greater sorption capacity than other plastic types. Finally, we highlight key knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to improve our ability to predict the risks associated with these ubiquitous contaminants in the environment by understanding their mobility, aggregation behavior and their potential to enhance the transport of other pollutants.},

However, most plastics in the environment will be aged to some extent; hence, understanding the effects of weathering and accurately mimicking weathering processes are crucial. By using microplastics that lack environmental relevance, we are unable to fully assess the risks associated with microplastic pollution in the environment. Emerging studies advocate for harmonization of experimental methods, however, the subject of reliable weathering protocols for realistic assessment has not been addressed. In this work, we critically analysed the current knowledge regarding protocols used for generating environmentally relevant microplastics and leachates for effects studies. We present the expected and overlooked weathering pathways that plastics will undergo throughout their lifecycle. International standard weathering protocols developed for polymers were critically analysed for their appropriateness for use in microplastics research. We show that most studies using weathered microplastics involve sorption experiments followed by toxicity assays. The most frequently reported weathered plastic types in the literature are polystyrene{$>$}polyethylene{$>$}polypropylene{$>$}polyvinyl chloride, which does not reflect the global plastic production and plastic types detected globally. Only \textasciitilde 10\% of published effect studies have used aged microplastics and of these, only 12 use aged nanoplastics. This highlights the need to embrace the use of environmentally relevant microplastics and to pay critical attention to the appropriateness of the weathering methods adopted moving forward.

  abstract = {Bioplastics are a broad category of materials encompassing bio-based, biodegradable, or both bio-based and biodegradable plastics. They can be manufactured from diverse sources, including crops (e.g., corn, sugar cane, and, historically, cotton), wood pulp, fungi, and other bio-based feedstocks produced with the help of algae or microbes. Some bio-based plastics, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and polylactic acid (PLA), are biodegradable under specific environmental conditions. Others, such as bio-polypropylene (bio-PP) and bio–polyethylene terephthalate (bio-PET), are also bio-based but are chemically equivalent to their conventional counterparts and do not biodegrade. Bioplastics can also include materials designed for biodegradation that are derived from fossil fuel–based rather than bio-based sources ([ 1 ][1]). Although bioplastics represent a small and growing segment within the industry, they are not a new idea and have a long history that is often overlooked or misunderstood. The earliest iterations of industrial-scale molding materials date to the mid-1800s and were sourced from trees (e.g., resins, gums, and latex). Hard rubber and gutta-percha are two early examples. Later bio-based plastics were made using cellulose, including celluloid and viscose rayon (fiber) and cellophane (film). Despite their biological origins, these materials had consequences for human health and the environment, leading to displacement, deforestation, environmental degradation, and workplace hazards. Popular accounts and even corporate advertisements from this era portray early-generation plastics relieving pressure on natural resources such as tortoise shell or ivory because they could imitate their appearance. For instance, celluloid, a nitrocellulose plastic industrialized in the 1870s, purportedly spared the elephant, especially from the billiard ball industry; however, market data show that celluloid did not decrease ivory demand, which grew in the years after celluloid's introduction. Less well known is how celluloid accelerated the demand for camphor, a tree product used as a solvent and plasticizer. The camphor market intensified as celluloid production expanded toward the end of the 19th century, when the burgeoning photography and cinematography industries required celluloid for film ([ 2 ][2]). Camphor was distilled from the camphor laurel tree, a species of evergreen especially prevalent in Taiwan, where the imperial regimes of China, Britain, and Japan vied for control over its production. The camphor trade decimated Taiwan's forests and displaced its Indigenous communities—most notably the Atayal peoples, who resisted the commodification of their homelands ([ 3 ][3]). Likewise, gutta-percha, a rubberlike tree resin harvested across the latter half of the 19th century in the Malay archipelago and throughout Southeast Asia, was used to insulate the growing network of undersea copper telegraphy cables so instrumental in administering the British empire. On average, a single tree would produce less than a pound of gum. In a matter of decades, the region's gutta-bearing trees were harvested to near-extinction ([ 4 ][4]). Rayon fibers are another 19th-century technology based on chemically regenerated cellulose sourced from cotton, cotton linters (remnants of cotton production), or wood pulp. Multiple rayon processes were developed first in the UK and then elsewhere. In the US, the viscose process (also used to manufacture cellophane) was dominant by the Second World War, the era in which annual global rayon production exceeded 2 billion pounds ([ 5 ][5]). The pursuit of rayon as a forest product, for example, resulted in clear-cut sections of the Tongass National Forest, a temperate rainforest in southeastern Alaska. After passage of the 1947 Tongass Timber Act, the US Forest Service offered 50-year timber contracts and subsidized the construction of two mills on the unceded lands of the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples. The first mill, built in Ketchikan, went online in 1952. The largest US rayon producer, American Viscose, had a considerable stake in the venture. Major Japanese manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Rayon, Kokoku Rayon, and Teikoku Rayon invested in the second mill built in Sitka. But deforestation and displacement were not the only consequences. Early bio-based plastics were also as hazardous to harvest as they were to transform into moldable materials, going back to hard rubber (e.g., vulcanite or ebonite). Industrialized in the 1840s after the development of vulcanization, hard rubber was made from caoutchouc (natural latex) extracted from multiple species found in the rainforests of South America and Southeast Asia. These were later husbanded through plantation economies, often violent and exploitative, as exemplified by the rubber plantations overseen by the regime of Belgium's King Leopold II in Congo ([ 6 ][6]). But whether wild or domesticated, harvesting latex was dangerous work. The hours were equally long in low-wage rubber factories. Poor ventilation exacerbated workers' exposure to a steady stream of toxic feed materials, including naphtha and carbon disulfide. From the outset, vulcanized rubber production caused a range of acute and chronic neurological issues, including mental health effects so severe that in extreme cases, workers were institutionalized. The idiom “to be gassed” originates from early rubber factories ([ 7 ][7]). Despite substantial evidence of its toxicity, carbon disulfide became instrumental to viscose rayon and cellophane production, too. As a result, successive generations of viscose workers into and across the 20th century also experienced neurological as well as cardiovascular effects ([ 8 ][8]). Occupational hazards extended to other classes of early bio-based plastics as well. Nineteenth-century celluloid factories were notoriously prone to explosion, conflagration, and worker injury ([ 9 ][9]). Pulp mills, such as the Ketchikan mill built in the Tongass, used a noxious sulfite process to convert chipped spruce and hemlock into dissolving pulp. Over its lifetime, the mill racked up hundreds of environmental violations before closing in the 1990s. By then, area health professionals had appealed to state epidemiologists to investigate possible links between mill pollution and conditions prevalent among their patients. Eventually, the mill was subject to both civil and criminal investigations. Further, the environmental legacy of rayon-grade pulp in the Tongass includes dioxins, heavy metals, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) ([ 10 ][10]). Natural and semisynthetic plastics were followed by a generation of fossil fuel–derived synthetics. Bakelite, invented in 1907, marked this passage and eventually replaced ivory in pool halls. Bakelite was made from the reaction of coal tar–derived phenol with formaldehyde synthesized via methanol. By the 1920s and early 1930s, a new class of vinyl plastics was also in development. One among several progenitor vinyls was Union Carbide's Vinylite, a copolymer of polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate, based on mixed feedstocks, notably ethane (a natural gas liquid). Further, Carbide's development of the then-new field of ethylene derivatives, which later capitalized on the hydrocarbon by-products of petroleum production, coupled with the rapid expansion of refinery and plastics manufacturing capacity catalyzed by the Second World War, helped facilitate the industry-wide transition toward the petrochemical-dominant plastics of today ([ 11 ][11]). But the advent of these fossil fuel feedstocks did not immediately eliminate prior biomass sources. Viscose is one example. Leading into the war, plastics were also an agricultural product, making use of farm waste or farmed products, a field called chemurgy ([ 12 ][12]). Early proponents included George Washington Carver and Henry Ford, who envisioned an integrated forest-farm-factory system. Ford purchased not only a rubber plantation in South America but also large tracts of farmland and timber stands in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where wood pulp was converted in the chemical distilleries at Iron Mountain into automotive paints and artificial leather. In general, 20th-century plastics tended to follow available raw materials, both geographically and across time. As nations shifted their energy and industrial systems, plastics manufacturers diversified feed material to make use of systemic by-products or waste products. One recent example is how some US plastics producers converted from crude oil or naphtha-based feedstocks to ethane, a by-product of natural gas production through hydraulic fracturing. The transition to renewable energy opens the question of which substrates will be used for future plastics. Understanding plastics' early industrial history is important because these bio-based products established the political-economic relations of modern, conventional plastics and portended problems to come. This history also points to the insufficiency of an ahistorical technological fix, such as swapping in alternative carbon sources, which may not improve plastics' ethics, safety, or sustainability. This is especially true if the same problematic chemistry is used to modify the base plastics' performance characteristics ([ 13 ][13]). For example, even if viscose/rayon is sourced from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified forests, its production may still rely on carbon disulfide. To avoid such problems, it is necessary to rethink the premises on which plastics technologies have been developed and produced. Critical adjuncts include reengineering plastics for recovery and reuse, augmenting recycling infrastructure ([ 14 ][14]), and source reduction and dematerialization. This means making fewer plastics by developing alternatives to their short-term, disposable uses, which presumes land access for landfills (i.e., long-term storage of solid waste or ash) ([ 15 ][15]). The challenge for bio-based plastics research is to account for this history and to think critically about the supply chains required by plastics currently in development, including a focus on ethical, sustainable feedstocks; toxics reduction and safer materials; and worker and community health and safety. 1.

However, there is limited information on carbon (C) fluxes from plants to soil, and dynamics of microbial immobilization where these practices have been employed. The objectives of this study were to quantify the photosynthesized C transported from maize to soil, and to assess the effect of mulching (with or without plastic film mulching) and fertilizer (no fertilizer control, medium-level organic manure, and high-level organic manure) application on the dynamics of microbial C sequestration. We used in-situ 13C pulse-labeling of maize planted at an experimental site in Liaoning Province, China. We found, on average, from 12\% to 15\% of net fixed 13C was translocated belowground up to 15 days after labeling. More than 60\% of 13C retained in soil was incorporated into microbial biomass C on the 1st day, but only less than 27\% on the 15th day after labeling. Treatments that combined organic manure application with mulching showed the greatest proportion of photosynthesized 13C incorporated belowground and the largest amount of microbial biomass C derived from rhizodeposits. These results demonstrate that organic manure application coupled with plastic film mulching facilitates photosynthesized C sequestration belowground and enhances soil microbial activity during the maize seedling stage.},

In high-dimensional or large sample size settings, interpretable analysis aims to reduce model complexity by finding a small subset of variables that significantly influences the model. The term “sparsity”, as used here, refers to calibration models having many zero-valued regression coefficients. Only the variables associated with non-zero coefficients influence the model. In this paper, we briefly review the regression problems associated with sparse models and discuss their spectroscopic applications. We also discuss how one can re-appropriate sparse modeling algorithms that perform wavelength selection for purposes of sample selection. In particular, we highlight specific sparse modeling algorithms that are easy to use and understand for the spectroscopist, as opposed to the overly complex “black-box” algorithms that dominate much of the statistical learning literature. We apply these sparse modeling approaches to three spectroscopic data sets.},

  abstract = {Protected cultivation, mainly represented by plastic-film mulching, has greatly improved crop production worldwide since the 1950s. However, despite its widespread use in tropical USA, Europe and China, its use in sub-Saharan Africa is not widespread. A field experiment was conducted using cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott) to evaluate the effects of two tillage systems (tilled and no-till) and plastic-film mulch (black and clear plastic-film mulch) on soil properties and cocoyam growth and yield in 2003 and 2004 planting seasons on a Typic paleudult in southeastern Nigeria. The experiment comprised six treatments and was laid out in the field using randomized complete block design replicated three times. Results showed that 70–80\% of the corms emerged 7–8 days (21 days after planting [DAP]) earlier in both tilled and no-till plastic-film mulched plots when compared to the unmulched plots. At later stages of crop development, the plants in the tilled black plastic-film mulched plots were taller by 61–67\% than those in the unmulched no-till plots, which had the lowest plant height (27–30 cm). At 98 DAP, there were no significant treatment differences in leaf area index (LAI) between tilled and no-till mulched plots with LAI of 15.5–19.8. However, LAI was reduced in both unmulched plots by 35–54\% when compared to the mulched plots. On the average soil temperature was higher in plastic-film mulched plots than that under plots without mulch by about 2 °C. Results show significantly lower soil bulk density (between 1.10 and 1.26 Mg m−3) in both tilled clear and black plastic-film mulched plots when compared to the corresponding no-till clear or black plastic-film mulched plots (1.40–1.45 Mg m−3). For the two seasons studied volumetric water content (VWC) in tilled black plastic-film mulched plots were significantly higher than VWC in other mulched plots by between 10 and 38\% in 2003 and between 17 and 30\% in 2004. At harvest (270 DAP) the highest corm yield was obtained in tilled black plastic mulched plots (29.1 Mg ha−1). This was higher (P = 0.05) than yields obtained in no-till, no mulch plots by 72\%. Yields were also higher in tilled black plastic mulched plots when compared to tilled clear plastic mulched plots, no-till black plastic mulched plots and no-till clear plastic mulched plots by 29, 47 and 59\%, respectively. These findings suggest that plastic mulched plots provide a better soil environment for cocoyam than unmulched plots and that tilled mulched plots especially tilled black plastic mulched plots provide superior edaphic environment for cocoyam when compared to other treatments used.},

  abstract = {Improved yield and nutrient content of food crops are important to both growers and consumers. We hypothesized that color of light reflected from the soil surface to developing leaves of field grown plants could result in modified concentrations of nutrients in edible roots. Carrot (Daucus carota L.) was used as the test plant. The plants were grown in trickle-irrigated field plots that were covered with panels that reflected various combinations of far-red (FR), red (R), and blue light (BL) to the growing leaves. The highest FR to R photon ratio reflected to developing leaves resulted in greatest shoot weight and the lowest root-to-shoot weight ratio. However, an increased quantity of photosynthetic light resulted in greater total weight per plant. Roots from yellow- and white-covered plots had highest concentrations of β-carotene and ascorbic acid. Those from yellow- and black-covered plots had highest concentration of phenolics. In general, concentrations were higher in cortex than in xylem tissues. We conclude that color of light reflected from the soil surface to developing leaves can influence yield and chemical composition of edible roots. This discovery suggests that color of light reflected to growing shoots may also influence chemical composition of plant species used as phytonutraceuticals.},

  abstract = {Abstract— Plastic mulches are widely used to conserve water and control weeds with less applied herbicides in production of food crops. Both yield and quality are important and can be affected by reflected blue (B), red (R) and far-red (FR) light combinations received during growth and development. Photosynthate allocation among growing plant parts and flavor of edible roots were studied in turnip (Brassica rapa L.) grown in trickle-irrigated field plots with blue, green and white mulches. The blue and green mulches reflected different amounts of B, but they both reflected FR/R ratios higher than the ratio in incoming sunlight. The white mulch reflected more photosyn-thetic light and a lower FR/R ratio than the blue or green mulches. Plants grown with blue and green mulches did not differ significantly in leaf length, root size and shoot/ root biomass ratio. Those grown with white had shorter leaves and larger roots. Taste testers found that plants grown with blue mulch developed roots with a sharp flavor, and roots from plants grown with green mulch had a mild flavor. Those grown with white had a less distinct flavor. Roots grown with blue mulch had the greatest concentrations of total glucosinolates (GSL) and ascorbic acid. Reducing sugar concentrations were higher in roots grown with green than in those grown with blue mulches. The comparison of chemical composition of roots from plants grown with blue versus green mulches is important because the main difference was the amount of reflected B, suggesting that B influenced an enzyme involved in the pathway from glucose to GSL. We conclude that the spectrum of light reflected from mulch on the soil surface can influence not only shoot/root biomass ratio but also flavor-related chemical composition of field-grown food crop plants.},

The effect of three plastic mulches (silver on black, photoselective thermal green, and black) in combination with spunbonded polyester rowcover (0.9 oz/yard2) on spring-planted watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) production was investigated. Two red-fleshed cultivars [Sangria (seeded) and Crimson Jewel (triploid)] were used. Plastic mulches increased early and total marketable yield in comparison with bare ground for both cultivars, but net benefit increased in ‘Crimson Jewel’ only. In contrast, yield and net benefit were the same among plastic mulches. Rowcover increased soil and air temperature, with the effect being greatest at lower ambient temperatures. During a near-freeze event, air temperature under the rowcover was about 7.2 °F higher than without a rowcover. Rowcover increased early and total marketable yield, but fruit weight decreased in both cultivars. Yield distribution into three fruit size categories was inconsistent between the cultivars. In ‘Sangria’, the large fruit category had the highest yield proportion for all treatments. In contrast, the highest yield proportion of ‘Crimson Jewel’, with exception of mulch without rowcover, corresponded to small fruit. Rowcover increased gross income at wholesale prices, but net benefit was not different from without rowcover. Protection of high-value plants, such as triploid watermelon, against light freezes, however, may still justify the use of rowcover in early plantings.},

The instantaneous evolution of the volatile compounds was studied by means of temperature-programmed pyrolysis experiments. The peaks varied in shape, temperature and size, and showed a marked dependence on coal rank. This can be attributed to the varying amounts of the different functional groups in the coals studied.

Weather colonization of microorganisms on MP will alter ecological niche and functioning of microbial communities remains still unanswered. Therefore, we compared the functional diversity of biofilms on microplastics when incubated in three lakes in northeastern Germany differing in trophy and limnological features. For all lakes, we compared heterotrophic activities of MP biofilms with those of microorganisms in the surrounding water by using Biolog® EcoPlates and assessed their oxygen consumption in microcosm assays with and without MP. The present study found that the total biofilm biomass was higher in the oligo-mesotrophic and dystrophic lakes than in the eutrophic lake. In all lakes, functional diversity profiles of MP biofilms consistently differed from those in the surrounding water. However, solely in the oligo-mesotrophic lake MP biofilms had a higher functional richness compared to the ambient water. These results demonstrate that the functionality and hence the ecological role of MP-associated microbial communities are context-dependent, i.e. different environments lead to substantial changes in biomass build up and heterotrophic activities of MP biofilms. We propose that MP surfaces act as new niches for aquatic microorganisms and that the constantly increasing MP pollution has the potential to globally impact carbon dynamics of pelagic environments by altering heterotrophic activities.},

  abstract = {The use of plastic row covers (plastic mulch) on vegetable farms increases runoff of pesticides after rainfall events and has been linked to toxic events in adjacent tidal waters. In coastal Virginia, USA, runoff from tomato fields with plastic mulch was suspected of causing mortality of commercial hard clam larvae at a hatchery located downstream of farming operations. Concern about the putative impacts of this practice on local waters resulted in a collection of studies to: (1) determine the sensitivity of early life stages of bivalves to copper, a commonly used fungicide; (2) examine acute and chronic biological effects of runoff on tidal creeks; and (3) examine the efficacy of management practices designed to reduce the delivery of pesticides to adjacent creeks. Laboratory bioassays revealed that 48-h LC50 values for embryonic clams Mulinia lateralis and Mercenaria mercenaria were 38 and 20 μg/l, respectively. In situ bioassays with Palaemonetes pugio showed that pulsed toxic conditions sometimes occur downstream of some tomato farms in plastic mulch following rainfall events. Growth, mortality rates and bioaccumulation of copper and organic pesticides in oysters were not correlated with the use of plastic mulch in watersheds. Sediment bioassays indicated potential toxicity in sediment collected downstream of some tomato fields in plastic mulch, but the effects were not consistent between years. Closer examination of management practices on the farms suggests that controlling runoff can prevent toxic impacts. Elevated levels of crop protectants measured at the outflow of farm ponds suggested that they may do little to reduce loadings of some pesticides. However, forested buffer zones and ephemeral sedimentation basins appeared to be effective in reducing pesticide concentrations in runoff and pulsed toxicity in tidal creeks.},

  abstract = {The control of weeds by solar heating of the soil using transparent polyethylene (PE) sheets was studied in the field during the summers of 1994 and 1995. The maximum soil temperature under plastic cover at 5 cm depth averaged 53 degrees C. At 5 cm soil depth, solarization increased temperature by about 9 degrees C. In the non-solarized soils, such high-temperature days were fewer. A temperature of 55 degrees C at 5 cm soil;depths was recorded both in irrigated and non-irrigated mulched soils. However, mulched soil recorded 70\% of the treatment period compared with 43\% in unirrigated and mulched soils. Lower depths of 10 and 15 cm did not attain a temperature 55 degrees C or 60 degrees C on any day during the experimental period. Solarization treatment with PE sheets significantly increased NO3--N and NH4+-N in comparison with non-solarized plots. While uncovered plots showed significant increase in available phosphorus and marginally increased in potassium and electrical conductivity. Organic carbon content and pH did not vary under different treatments. PE mulching for 30 days significantly reduced the number of weed seeds, specifically Avena fatua L. and Phalaris minor Retz., while Trianthema monogyna Linn. and Asphodelus tenuifolius Cav. were not affected much in comparison with the former. Melilotus indica (L.) All. was not at all affected by the solarization treatment studied. The solarization reduction index (SRI) was calculated for each weed species studied and it was concluded that weeds having a low SRI can be controlled more effectively than weeds with high SRI values. The heating effect from solarization decreased significantly with soil depth. The 30 days' soil solarization treatment in moist soil was more effective than the 10 and 20 days' heating treatment in moist and dry soils for weed control.},

A mixture of fresh sheep manure and dry chicken litter (SCM) and a semi-composted mixture of horse manure and chicken litter (HCM) were applied at 5.1~kg~m−2 (dry weight) under plastic sheets to reduce Phytophthora inoculum survival rate and disease incidence. Non-solarised (C) and solarised (S) soils were used as control treatments. Mean NH3 concentration increased in SCM during biodisinfestation process (14.8~mg NH3~m−3) compared with HCM (9.1~mg NH3~m−3), accounted for the higher organic N content and potential N mineralisation. The higher NH3 concentration in SCM could have contributed to reduce the inoculum survival rate (30.6\% and 75.0\% in SCM and HCM plots, respectively). Inoculum survival rate was not reduced in S (94.4\%) as temperature was below 33~°C throughout the experimental period. After biodisinfestation treatment, N2O and CO2 emissions tended to be higher in SCM, despite high spatial variability. Cumulative N2O emissions were 1.31 and 0.42~g N2O-N~m−2 in SCM and HCM after 43 days. The larger N application and organic N mineralisation rate on fresh manure amended soils might have contributed to higher N2O emissions during and after soil biodisinfestation by denitrification and nitrification, respectively. Cumulative CO2 emission averaged 211.0 and 159.9~g CO2-C~m−2 in SCM and HCM, respectively. The soluble organic C, more abundant in fresh manure, might have favoured soil respiration in SCM. Disease incidence decreased in SCM and HCM plots (disease incidence, 2\%–8\%) in relation to solarised soils (42\%) after 4 months. Microbial suppressiveness might have contributed to minimise Phytophthora disease incidence in SCM and HCM plots. Pepper fruit yield increased with manure amendment in SCM and HCM, which averaged 4.6 and 4.3~kg~m−2, respectively. Further research will be necessary to guarantee an effective Phytophthora biodisinfestation by fitting manure N and organic matter applications, improving crop yield and reducing greenhouse gas pollution.},

An application based on two Mediterranean rural areas in Andalusia in Southern Spain is presented.

There were 10 panels, each containing 16 photos, and 226 participants ranked the best four and worst four pictures of each panel. Each participant ranked an average of 7.3 panels. The results show that perceived visual quality increases, in decreasing order of importance, with the degree of wilderness of the landscape, the presence of well-preserved man-made elements, the percentage of plant cover, the amount of water, the presence of mountains and the colour contrast.},

Transparent and blue plastic mulches encouraged weed population which were suppressed under black plastic. Plant height, number of primary branches, stem base diameter, number of leaves and yield were better for the plants on plastic. At the mature green stage, fruits had the highest vitamin-C content on the black plastic. Mulching produced the fruits with the highest chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b and total chlorophyll contents and also increased the number of fruits per plant and yield. However, mulching did not affect the length and diameter of the fruits and number of seeds per fruit. Plants on black plastic mulch had the maximum number of fruits and highest yield. Thus, mulching appears to be a viable tool to increase the chilli production under tropical conditions.},

For a more detailed investigation of the thermal degradation behaviour of waxy materials, relevant model compounds were selected. Hexadecylpalmitate, cholesterylstearate, heptadecanoic acid and 1-hexacosanol were examined under identical Py–GC–MS conditions. From the resulting product distribution general statements were able to be derived according to the thermal degradation pathways of typical wax constituents. The findings obtained from the model compounds were then applied to the interpretation of the real wax pyrograms. As a result, conclusions according to their origin from corresponding wax constituents were drawn for the majority of pyrolysis products. Thus, the extended potential of the method for the compositional analysis of natural waxes is demonstrated.},

In contrast, plastics that reside in agricultural soils consist of polydisperse fragments resulting from degraded films employed in agriculture. There exists a need for more representative materials in fundamental studies of the fate, transport, and ecotoxicity of MPs and NPs in soil ecosystems. The objective of this study was therefore to develop a procedure to produce MPs and NPs from agricultural plastics (a mulch film prepared biodegradable polymer polybutyrate adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) and low-density PE [LDPE]), and to characterize the resultant materials. Soaking of PBAT films under cryogenic conditions promoted embrittlement, similar to what occurs through environmental weathering. LDPE and cryogenically-treated PBAT underwent mechanical milling followed by sieve fractionation into MP fractions of 840 μm, 250 μm, 106 μm, and 45 μm. The 106 μm fraction was subjected to wet grinding to produce NPs of average particle size 366.0 nm and 389.4 nm for PBAT and LDPE, respectively. A two-parameter Weibull model described the MPs' particle size distributions, while NPs possessed bimodal distributions. Size reduction did not produce any changes in the chemical properties of the plastics, except for slight depolymerization and an increase of crystallinity resulting from cryogenic treatment. This study suggests that MPs form from cutting and high-impact mechanical degradation as would occur during the tillage into soil, and that NPs form from the MP fragments in regions of relative weakness that possess lower molecular weight polymers and crystallinity.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) have been recognized as transport vectors for micropollutants in the natural water environment and the food web; therefore, the sorption behavior of contaminant on MPs has recently gained an increased attention. However, a consensus has not yet been reached and information about the adsorption of water contaminants on real MPs remains elusive. Herein, we raise the question of “Should we continue using pure polymers as surrogates for real MPs?” This first systematic study compared the adsorption of multiple micropollutants (i.e. a pesticide, a pharmaceutical, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) on a large set of MPs (i.e. 20 well-characterized MPs) and kaolin. Material characterizations results showed various physicochemical and compositional differences between real and pure MPs. Pure polymers had lower normalized uptake values than real MPs in most cases. This was attributed to the surface roughness and/or the presence of fillers (e.g. talc and glass fiber) in real samples. Further, preloaded MPs with natural organic matter (NOM) showed an increased uptake of micropollutants due to forming a complex with NOM and/or co-sorption. These findings indicate that employing real MPs in research studies is critical for obtaining environmentally meaningful results, and the evaluation of MPs sorption behavior without NOM preloading can result in a significant underestimation for their actual values. We also provided an outlook the key areas for further investigations.},

Several organisms can ingest microplastics with potentially adverse effects on the digestive tract, respiratory system and locomotory appendages. However, a clear evidence of tissue accumulation and transfer of such microparticles in wild organisms is still lacking, partially hampered by technical difficulties in isolation and characterization protocols from biological samples. In this work, we compared the efficacy of some existing approaches and we optimized a new protocol allowing an extraction yield of microplastics from fish tissues ranging between 78\% and 98\%, depending on the polymer size. FT-IR analyses confirmed that the extraction procedure did not affect the particles characteristics. The method was further validated on the fish mullet, Mugil cephalus, exposed under laboratory conditions to polystyrene and polyethylene; the particles were isolated and quantified in stomach and liver, and their presence in the hepatic tissue was confirmed also by histological analyses. A preliminary characterization revealed the presence and distribution of microplastics in various fish species collected along the Adriatic Sea. FT-IR analyses indicated polyethylene as the predominant polymer (65\%) in the stomach of fish. The overall results confirmed the newly developed method as a reliable approach to detect and quantify microplastics in the marine biota.},

To meet the growing demand for their quantitation in diverse environmental media, the use of preconcentration approaches (such as solid phase extraction) has become an essential component to practically upgrade both procedural efficiency and the analytical sensitivity. Nanomaterials (NMs) are realized as excellent candidates for proper sorption media because of their unique structural and surface properties with noticeably enhanced sorption capability towards contaminants. This review explores the use of various NMs (metallic and mixed oxide nanoparticles (NPs), carbon NMs (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene oxide), polymer-based nanocomposites (organic polymers, inorganic and hybrid polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers, and dendrimers), and silicon/magnetic NPs) as potential sorbents for analytical applications. In this review, the distinctive features of NM-based sorptive extraction techniques are examined comprehensively with the discussion on their future prospects and key challenges.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the current knowledge on tyre and road wear particles (TRWP) is compiled regarding all environmental and health aspects. TRWP generated on roads during driving processes contribute to airborne non-exhaust emissions and are discussed in connection with the microplastic pollution. The major amount of TRWP consists of coarser heterogenous particles released to road surface, soils and aquatic compartments. The extensive compilation of annual emissions of tyre wear for numerous countries shows per-capita-masses ranging from 0.2 to 5.5 kg/(cap*a). Ecotoxicological studies revealed effects on aquatic organisms, but test concentrations and materials do not reflect environmental conditions. Contribution of tyre wear to PM10 accounts for up to approx. 11 mass \%. A recent thorough risk assessment indicates the risk for human health via inhalation to be low, but no information is available on the risk caused by intake via the food chain. Data on degradation is scarce and most studies do not use realistic materials and conditions. The only published degradation study performed under environmental conditions implies a half-life of tyre rubber particles in soils of 16 months. For truck tyres, which mainly contain natural rubber, shorter periods were observed under optimum conditions in laboratory tests. Concentrations of tyre wear compiled from environmental monitoring studies show highly variable concentrations in road runoff, road dust, roadside soils, river sediments and river water, with a general decrease following the transport paths. However, the behaviour of TRWP in freshwater referring to transport, degradation, and sedimentation is still unclarified. Environmental monitoring of TRWP is still hampered by challenges for analytics. Thus, data on environmental concentrations is rare and has mainly exemplary character. Further research is needed with regard to emission factors, development of analytical methods for environmental matrices, long-period monitoring, fate in surface waters and soils, (eco)toxicological impacts and degradation under realistic conditions.},

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of microplastic exposure using as a bioindicator the species Lumbricus terrestris, exposed to different concentrations of microplastic (2.5\%; 5\%, and 7\% w/w). Avoidance bioassays were carried out for 48~h in soil with and without microplastic; the gastrointestinal tract—crop/gizzard, foregut, and midgut—was dissected and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was used as a biomarker of neurotoxicity stress. In parallel, bioassays of microplastic ingestion were carried out, and after 48~h of initiating the ingestion assay, using a stereo and fluorescence microscope, the microplastic distribution was observed in the different earthworm segments. The results obtained in the avoidance assay indicated a lack of preference for either soil type; however, upon moving, the earthworms lost surface mucus, resulting in burns and lesions on their bodies, which were reflected in the increase in AChE enzyme levels, which was not directly related to microplastic ingestion, but rather likely acts as an external physical stress agent. The results of the ingestion bioassay showed that microplastic was present in all the earthworm segments, with a higher number of particles in the hindgut. The Lumbricus terrestris did not distinguish microplastics from soil particles, and given the high exposure concentrations, microplastics produced physical lesions on the mucus membranes of earthworms. Lumbricus terrestris showed to be a suitable bioindicator for testing the exposure to microplastic contamination in soil.},

  abstract = {Microplastic (plastic particles measuring {$<$}5mm) pollution is ubiquitous. Unlike in other well-studied ecosystems, for example, marine and freshwater environments, microplastics in terrestrial systems are relatively understudied. Their potential impacts on terrestrial environments, in particular the risk of causing ecological surprise, must be better understood and quantified. Ecological surprise occurs when ecosystem behavior deviates radically from expectations and generally has negative consequences for ecosystem services. The properties and behavior of microplastics within terrestrial environments may increase their likelihood of causing ecological surprises as they (a) are highly persistent global pollutants that will last for centuries, (b) can interact with the abiotic environment in a complex manner, (c) can impact terrestrial organisms directly or indirectly and (d) interact with other contaminants and can facilitate their transport. Here, we compiled findings of previous research on microplastics in terrestrial environments. We systematically focused on studies addressing different facets of microplastics related to their distribution, dispersion, impact on soil characteristics and functions, levels of biological organization of tested terrestrial biota (single species vs. assemblages), scale of experimental study and corresponding ecotoxicological effects. Our systematic assessment of previous microplastic research revealed that most studies have been conducted on single species under laboratory conditions with short-term exposures; few studies were conducted under more realistic long-term field conditions and/or with multi-species assemblages. Studies targeting multi-species assemblages primarily considered soil bacterial communities and showed that microplastics can alter essential nutrient cycling functions. More ecologically meaningful studies of terrestrial microplastics encompassing multi-species assemblages, critical ecological processes (e.g., biogeochemical cycles and pollination) and interactions with other anthropogenic stressors must be conducted. Addressing these knowledge gaps will provide a better understanding of microplastics as emerging global stressors and should lower the risk of ecological surprise in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Interactions were investigated by exposing particles of uPVC and UHMW PE to mixtures of 3H and 14C radiolabelled Phe and DDT. Changes in sorption capacity were modelled by applying a Freundlich binding sorption isotherms. An Extended Langmuir Model and an Interaction Factor Model were also applied to predict equilibrium concentrations of pollutants onto plastic. This study showed that in a bi-solute system, DDT exhibited no significantly different sorption behaviour than in single solute systems. However, DDT did appear to interfere with the sorption of Phe onto plastic, indicating an antagonistic effect.},

However, to date, the models have not incorporated consideration of the role of gut surfactants, or the influence of pH or temperature on desorption, whilst experimental work has shown that these factors can enhance desorption of sorbed contaminants several fold. Here, we modelled the transfer of sorbed organic contaminants dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), phenanthrene (Phe) and bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from microscopic particles of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) to a benthic invertebrate, a fish and a seabird using a one-compartment model OMEGA (Optimal Modelling for EcotoxicoloGical Applications) with different conditions of pH, temperature and gut surfactants. Environmental concentrations of contaminants at the bottom and the top of published ranges were considered, in combination with ingestion of either 1 or 5\% by weight of plastic. For all organisms, the combined intake from food and water was the main route of exposure for Phe, DEHP and DDT with a negligible input from plastic. For the benthic invertebrate, predictions including the presence of contaminated plastic resulted in very small increases in the internal concentrations of DDT and DEHP, while the net change in the transfer of Phe was negligible. While there may be scenarios in which the presence of plastic makes a more important contribution, our modelling study suggests that ingestion of microplastic does not provide a quantitatively important additional pathway for the transfer of adsorbed chemicals from seawater to biota via the gut.},

  abstract = {Environmental context Increasing global plastic production adds plastic debris to the environment. We show that potentially harmful additives present in plastic particles are released to water at an increased rate when material properties change by aging due to exposure to high temperature and especially to UV radiation. For risk assessment of such plastic additives, more information on their degradation products and their toxicity is needed. Abstract Recycled plastic granules of high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene the size of microplastics were exposed to artificial aging conditions (2000h; photooxidative and thermo-oxidative) to simulate their fate outdoors. Their potential to leach into water during the aging process was investigated using column percolation tests. Aging-related changes on the surface of the material were characterised by IR measurements indicating oxidation reactions with the formation of new adsorption bands (C=O, C–O and OH), especially in the case of photooxidative aging. These findings were confirmed by the identification of leachable organic compounds. Leaching of total organic carbon, Cl, Ca, Cu and Zn is clearly affected by changes due to aging, and their release is increased after photooxidative aging. In general, exposure to photooxidative conditions shows a greater influence on aging and thus on leaching and seems to be the more important mechanism for the aging of microplastic in the environment. Comparison with the total content of inorganic species revealed that, for most elements, less than 3\% of the total content is released after 2000h of photooxidative aging.},

Both artificial water including defined MP fractions and the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant were used to verify the derived sampling procedure, sample preparation and the subsequent analysis of MP using thermal extraction-desorption gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (TED-GC-MS). A major finding of this paper is that an application of various particle size classes greatly improves the practical handling of the sampling equipment. Size classes also enable the TED-GC-MS to provide any data on the MP size distribution, a substantial sampling property affecting both the necessary sampling volume and the optimal sampling depth. In the artificial water with defined MP fractions, the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 110\%, depending on the different MP types and MP size classes. In the treated wastewater, we found both polyethylene and polystyrene in different size classes and quantities.},

During the last decade the industry has developed a variety of new mulch PE film formulations with numerous positive effects on watermelon production. In order to define the influence of mulching on growth and yield of watermelon and on aphid populations landing in the crop, we carried out field experiments at two locations (Pula and Opuzen) in the Mediterranean part of Croatia. Watermelon was grown on black, brown, clear, green, and white PE films. During the first 60 days after planting (DAP) the highest soil temperatures, at 5 cm depth, were recorded under the clear PE film, Positive correlation of vine length, branch number and early and total yield was found to both sum and average soil temperatures during the first 60 DAP in three of the total of five experiments. Clear PE films had generally positive effects on vegetative growth and early yield while the trend for white PE films was quite the opposite. For the majority of the observed traits we found no difference between semi-transparent (brown and green) mulches. The effects of semi-transparent films (brown and green) on watermelon vegetative growth and yield were similar to each other. During two years in Opuzen, we recorded 70 species of Aphididae of 48 genera, with 11 species making up more than 1\% in each year. Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) and Aphis gossypii Glover were the most dominant species in 2004. The number of winged aphids was consistently lower under clear and black PE films. According to our results, clear PE film could be recommended for an early spring planting under conditions of the Mediterranean climate.},

  abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines. Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences ( fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.},

Similarities between the biotransformation of DEHP by rainbow trout and mammalian species included (a) mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) appeared to be the obligatory first step in DEHP metabolism; (b) the phthalate ring was not oxidized; (c) phthalic acid was a minor metabolite; and (d) several metabolites contained multiple oxidations of the 2-ethylhexyl moiety of MEHP. No metabolites unique to rainbow trout were identified. However, fewer oxidized metabolites were identified in rainbow trout than in mammalian species, possibly due to limited mitochondrial metabolism of MEHP in rainbow trout. The amount of biliary MEHP glucuronide after intravascular administration of DEHP was substantially less than reported in rainbow trout exposed to DEHP via the water. Results confirmed that DEHP metabolism in rainbow trout proceeds by initial rapid formation of MEHP, followed by excretion or extensive oxidation by microsomal P450.},

Toxic effects and environmental persistence of certain additive chemicals impact the sustainability of the industry. Green chemistry has been and will continue to be applied to find solutions to these issues. This review focuses on alternatives to phthalate plasticizers and halogenated flame retardants, two categories that together account for a significant portion of the global additives market and the global dispersion of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Small-molecule alternatives that exist in various stages of research and commercialization will be discussed, with emphasis on the use of renewable resources. The rise of biorefineries and new bio-based monomers may help overcome existing economic barriers to adoption of alternatives. Increasing the molecular weight of additives or covalently linking them to polymer backbones are two promising strategies for reducing both mobility and toxicity that will also be discussed. Finally, the design of new polymers that show desirable properties without the use of additives will be considered. The substances put forward as "green" alternatives have yet to receive the same level of scrutiny as diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP, also known as dioctyl phthalate) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Cooperation between chemists, engineers, and the environmental health community will be critical to ensure the safety and sustainability of new technologies.},

The method is applicable to small samples of ∼120 μg. The limits of detection are below 1 mg kg−1 for bisphenol A and for bisphenol S. The limits of quantification are about 1.3 mg kg−1. Several validation characteristics of the method developed like standard error of calibration, limit of determination, linearity, and accuracy are given. To prove the accuracy of the method, interferences and matrix dependencies were also investigated. The influence of the pyrolysis crucibles, a special effect of analytical pyrolysis, was additionally investigated.

The aim of this ILC was to investigate the state of the art of microplastic analysis and to support the development of microplastic reference materials. This report describes the technical details of the study, starting with the preparation and characterisation of the PET-containing test items up to the processing of the obtained data. It provides an evaluation of the measurement results produced by almost 100 participating laboratories, together with information about the methods and practices applied by the study participants. Results were evaluated in relation to the questionnaire answers provided in order to detect possible correlations. A technical workshop was held to discuss the findings with the participating laboratories.The study gives a comprehensive picture of current methods and procedures applied in the measurement of microplastics in water. Sixteen different analysis techniques were used in this ILC, but no (group of) methods could be identified that systematically seem to give results more consistent with the indicative range of expected results than others. Furthermore, a great variety of experimental practices was applied, making it difficult to identify individual factors that significantly influenced the measurement outcome. The results of this comprehensive study provides valuable input for further harmonisation and standardisation efforts towards reliable measurement of microplastics in water and other matrices.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene (PE) mulching is a very common method in agriculture worldwide because the use of PE films can improve product quality and yield by mitigating extreme weather changes, optimizing growth conditions and extending the growing season. Other than the problem with disposal of the plastics hardly any other of its effects on the environment are known. To determine whether covering fields with PE films affects N2O emission, we conducted two experiments: first, comparing N2O emissions of furrows and PE-mulched ridges of a radish field which had received different amounts of N fertilizer and second, assessing whether PE mulching increases N2O emissions from PE-mulched ridges in comparison to non-PE-mulched ridges and furrows of a non-fertilized field. To achieve those aims we took comparative closed chamber measurements in conjunction with a photoacoustic infrared trace gas analyzer during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 at a radish and soy bean field site in South Korea. For the radish field site we found significant differences between the N2O emitted by furrows and PE-mulched ridges and found extraordinarily low N2O fluxes from those spots of the ridges which were totally PE-mulch-covered between plant hole openings. At the soy bean field we observed that plant holes of PE-mulched ridges showed only 68\% of the emission measured of soils around soy bean plants of non-PE-mulched ridges, implying that PE mulching may decrease N2O emissions. Since our result is contrary to very recent findings we consider the extremely low soil moisture at our sites as explanation for the differences. Because knowledge on how PE mulches affect production and emissions of greenhouse gases is very limited, our study contributes greatly to understanding N2O emission behavior of PE-mulched, poor sandy soils in a temperate monsoon climate.},

Polymer composition varied strongly, but varnish, rubber, polyethylene, and polyamide dominated overall. Most particles were in the smallest size range indicating large numbers of particles below the detection limit of 11 μm. Our data highlight that atmospheric transport and deposition can be notable pathways for MPs meriting more research.

  abstract = {One of the main sources of plastic pollution in agricultural fields is the plastic mulch used by farmers to improve crop production. The plastic mulch is often not removed completely from the fields after harvest. Over time, the plastic mulch that is left of the fields is broken down into smaller particles which are dispersed by the wind or runoff. In the Region of Murcia in Spain, plastic mulch is heavily used for intensive vegetable farming. After harvest, sheep are released into the fields to graze on the vegetable residues. The objective of the study was to assess the plastic contamination in agricultural soil in Spain and the ingestion of plastic by sheep. Therefore, three research questions were established: i) What is the plastic content in agricultural soils where plastic mulch is commonly used? ii) Do livestock ingest the microplastics found in the soil? iii) How much plastic could be transported by the livestock? To answer these questions, we sampled top soils (0–10~cm) from 6 vegetable fields and collected sheep faeces from 5 different herds. The microplastic content was measured using density separation and visual identification. We found \textasciitilde 2~×~103 particles∙kg−1 in the soil and \textasciitilde 103 particles∙kg−1 in the faeces. The data show that plastic particles were present in the soil and that livestock ingested them. After ingesting plastic from one field, the sheep can become a source of microplastic contamination as they graze on other farms or grasslands. The potential transport of microplastics due to a herd of 1000 sheep was estimated to be \textasciitilde 106 particles∙ha−1∙y−1. Further studies should focus on: assessing how much of the plastic found in faeces comes directly from plastic mulching, estimating the plastic degradation in the guts of sheep and understanding the potential effects of these plastic residues on the health of livestock.},

A range of studies have found significant levels of microplastics in beach sand. However, there is a considerable amount of methodological variability among these studies. Methodological variation currently limits comparisons as there is no standard procedure for sampling or extraction of microplastics. We identify key sampling and extraction procedures across the literature through a detailed review. We find that sampling depth, sampling location, number of repeat extractions, and settling times are the critical parameters of variation. Next, using a case-study we determine whether and to what extent these differences impact study outcomes. By investigating the common practices identified in the literature with the case-study, we provide a standard operating procedure for sampling and extracting microplastics from beach sand.},

On the other hand, plastic debris in the environment undergoes chemical and physical degradation processes leading not only to mechanical but also to molecular fragmentation quickly resulting in the formation of leachable, soluble and/or volatile degradation products that are released in the environment. We performed the analysis of reference MPs–polymer micropowders obtained by grinding a set of five polymer types down to final size in the 857–509 μm range, namely high- and low-density polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The reference MPs were artificially aged in a solar-box to investigate their degradation processes by characterizing the aged (photo-oxidized) MPs and their low molecular weight and/or highly oxidized fraction. For this purpose, the artificially aged MPs were subjected to extraction in polar organic solvents, targeting selective recovery of the low molecular weight fractions generated during the artificial aging. Analysis of the extractable fractions and of the residues was carried out by a multi-technique approach combining evolved gas analysis–mass spectrometry (EGA–MS), pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py–GC–MS), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The results provided information on the degradation products formed during accelerated aging. Up to 18 wt\% of extractable, low molecular weight fraction was recovered from the photo-aged MPs, depending on the polymer type. The photo-degradation products of polyolefins (PE and PP) included a wide range of long chain alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and hydroxy acids, as detected in the soluble fractions of aged samples. SEC analyses also showed a marked decrease in the average molecular weight of PP polymer chains, whereas cross-linking was observed in the case of PS. The most abundant low molecular weight photo-degradation products of PS were benzoic acid and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, while PET had the highest stability towards aging, as indicated by the modest generation of low molecular weight species.},

However, there are several links between the terrestrial and aquatic environments. We analyzed drainage water samples from agricultural soils in the Seeland, a heavily drained agriculturally intensive area in Switzerland for its MP ({$>$}100~μm) concentration and composition. We found MP in relevant numbers (mean 10.5~±~9.5~N~L−1). The polymers were mainly PA and PE, and the size distribution showed an exponential increase with decreasing particle size. The results show considerable MP concentrations in drainage water and imply a transport of MP in soils down to the drainage pipes. Given the large areas drained both in Switzerland and globally, it is proposed that MP leaching from soil can be a significant source of MP to aquatic ecosystems. Such a contribution should be considered when dealing with MP cycling on a local to global scale.},

However, quantitative information of the terrestrial occurrence, fate and exposure of phthalate and non-phthalate plasticisers is lacking. Research into this field is needed, especially as society moves away from phthalates to the next generation of plasticisers which may themselves represent an emerging risk. Abstract Modern society is widely dependent upon plastic. Therefore, it is unsurprising that macro- and microplastic pollution is found in every environmental compartment on earth. Plasticisers are chemicals added to plastics to increase their flexibility. Like plastics themselves, plasticisers are also widely present in the environment. Plasticisers and plastic debris may undergo long-range transport in the atmosphere and the oceans, contaminating even the most remote areas of land. In addition, although plasticisers typically degrade in a matter of weeks–months, they can persist in soil for decades and have been shown to occur in all land uses studied. Some plasticisers are genotoxic and can be taken up by soil organisms, which may pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. To date the majority of data on plasticisers exists for phthalates. However, plasticisers are a diverse range of chemicals and with the increasing transfer to non-phthalate alternatives, research into the fate and effects of emerging plasticisers is required to determine their environmental risk and management options. Data on the occurrence and ecotoxicity of emerging plasticisers, in addition to the impacts of all plasticisers on terrestrial ecosystems, therefore, remain a key research need within the wider plastics debate.},

The yield and yield-contributing characters in the mulched treatments for all levels of irrigation were significantly higher compared to those in the unmulched treatments. The yield of tomato increased with the increasing amount of irrigation water in unmulched treatment. The trend was reversed when drip irrigation was coupled with mulches. The highest yield for each mulch (81.12 t/ha for polyethylene and 79.49 t/ha for straw) was obtained when 50\% of water requirement was applied. With 100\% water application, polyethylene-mulched treatment produced lower yield than the straw-mulched treatment. The highest water use efficiency of 592 kg/ha/mm was obtained with 50\% water application under polyethylene mulch. The highest net return (US\$ 7098/ha), incremental net return(US\$ 1556/ha), and incremental benefit-cost ratio (7.03) were found for 50\% water application with straw mulch.

Wastewater treatment systems have been proposed as pathways for MPs pollution to receiving waters but quantitative and qualitative data on MP occurrence and transport remains limited, hindering risk assessment and regulation. Here, for the first time, the stepwise abundance and loading of MPs (60–2800 μm) in a tertiary wastewater treatment plant in the UK was assessed by sampling from May 2017 to February 2018. Microplastics were found in all sampling campaigns, with an average inflow of 8.1 × 108 (95\% CI, 3.8 × 108 to 1.2 × 109) items day−1. Their prevalence decreased from influent to final effluent. Overall abundances decreased on average by 6\%, 68\%, 92\%, and 96\% after the pre-treatment, primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment stages respectively, although considerable variability occurred throughout the year. Sufficient particles remained in the treated effluent to generate an average discharge of 2.2 × 107 (95\% CI, 1.2 × 107 to 3.2 × 107]) particles day−1 to the recipient river. Secondary MPs were predominant, while primary MP abundances were minimal. Fibres comprised 67\% of all items, followed by films (18\%) and fragments (15\%). Chemical characterisation confirmed the presence of different types of polymers, with polypropylene fibres and fragments most abundant (23\%). This research informs understanding of how wastewater effluent may channel MPs to the natural environment and their composition, and helps understand control points for optimising advanced treatment processes.},

  abstract = {The potential of principal component regression (PCR) for mixture resolution by UV-visible spectrophotometry was assessed. For this purpose, a set of binary mixtures with Gaussian bands was simulated, and the influence of spectral overlap on the precision of quantification was studied. Likewise, the results obtained in the resolution of a mixture of components with extensively overlapped spectra were investigated in terms of spectral noise and the criterion used to select the optimal number of principal components. The model was validated by cross-validation, and the number of significant principal components was determined on the basis of four different criteria. Three types of noise were considered: intrinsic instrumental noise, which was modeled from experimental data provided by an HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer; constant baseline shifts; and baseline drift. Introducing artificial baseline alterations in some samples of the calibration matrix was found to increase the reliability of the proposed method in routine analysis. The method was applied to the analysis of mixtures of Ti, AI, and Fe by resolving the spectra of their 8-hydroxyquinoline complexes previously extracted into chloroform.},

  abstract = {At least 300 Mio t of plastic are produced annually, from which large parts end up in the environment, where it persists over decades, harms biota and enters the food chain. Yet, almost nothing is known about plastic pollution of soil; hence, the aims of this work are to review current knowledge on i) available methods for the quantification and identification of plastic in soil, ii) the quantity and possible input pathways of plastic into soil, (including first preliminary screening of plastic in compost), and iii) its fate in soil. Methods for plastic analyses in sediments can potentially be adjusted for application to soil; yet, the applicability of these methods for soil needs to be tested. Consequently, the current data base on soil pollution with plastic is still poor. Soils may receive plastic inputs via plastic mulching or the application of plastic containing soil amendments. In compost up to 2.38-1200 mg plastic kg(-1) have been found so far; the plastic concentration of sewage sludge varies between 1000 and 24,000 plastic items kg(-1). Also irrigation with untreated and treated wastewater (1000-627,000 and 0-125,000 plastic items m(-3), respectively) as well as flooding with lake water (0.82-4.42 plastic items m(-3)) or river water (0-13,751 items km(-2)) can provide major input pathways for plastic into soil. Additional sources comprise littering along roads and trails, illegal waste dumping, road runoff as well as atmospheric input. With these input pathways, plastic concentrations in soil might reach the per mill range of soil organic carbon. Most of plastic (especially {$>$} 1 mu m) will presumably be retained in soil, where it persists for decades or longer. Accordingly, further research on the prevalence and fate of such synthetic polymers in soils is urgently warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The volatile thermal decomposition products were analysed on line using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The product analysis revealed that the decomposition reactions of the polymer constituents are significantly altered in the presence of the strong inorganic bases. Due to debromination of the dibromo- and tribromophenyl groups of brominated polystyrene, copyrolysis with sodium hydroxide and with basic zeolites resulted in a considerably reduced yield of dibromo- and tribromostyrenes. From brominated epoxy resins pyrolysed with sodium hydroxide an enhanced bromomethane evolution, while a depressed brominated phenol formation was observed. A diminished production of bromophenols takes place in pyrolysis with sodium-containing silicates as well.},

Plots were amended with fresh broccoli or grass (3.4 to 4.0 kg fresh weight m-2) or left nonamended, and covered with an airtight plastic cover (0.135 mm thick) or left noncovered. In plots amended with broccoli or grass and covered with plastic sheeting, anaerobic and strongly reducing soil conditions developed quickly, as indicated by rapid depletion of oxygen and a decrease in redox potential values to as low as -200 mV. After 15 weeks, survival of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi, Rhizoctonia solani, and Verticillium dahliae in inoculum samples buried 15 cm deep was strongly reduced in amended, covered plots in both experiments. The pathogens were not or hardly inactivated in amended, noncovered soil or nonamended, covered soil. The latter indicates that thermal inactivation due to increased soil temperatures under the plastic cover was not involved in pathogen inactivation. The results show the potential for this approach to control various soilborne pathogens and that it may serve as an alternative to chemical soil disinfestation for high-value crops under conditions where other alternatives, such as solarization or soil flooding, are not effective or not feasible.},

  abstract = {To date erosion scientists have failed to address — or have addressed inadequately — some of the ‘big questions’ of our discipline. For example, where is erosion occurring? Why is it happening, and who is to blame? How serious is it? Who does it affect? What should be the response? Can we prevent it? What are the costs of erosion? Our inability or reluctance to answer such questions damages our credibility and is based on weaknesses in commonly-used approaches and the spatial and temporal scales at which much research is carried out. We have difficulty in the recognition, description and quantification of erosion, and limited information on the magnitude and frequency of events that cause erosion. In particular there has been a neglect of extreme events which are known to contribute substantially to total erosion. The inadequacy and frequent misuse of existing data leaves us open to the charge of exaggeration of the erosion problem (a la Lomborg). Models need to be developed for many purposes and at many scales. Existing models have proved to be of limited value, in the real as opposed to the academic world, both because of problems with the reliability of their results, and difficulties (with associated costs) of acquiring suitable data. However, there are some positive signs: models are now being developed for purposes including addressing questions of off-site impacts and land-use policy. Cheap, reliable and technically simple methods of erosion assessment at the field scale are needed. At the global scale, an up-date of GLASOD based on a scientific approach is urgent so that we are at least able to identify erosion ‘hotspots’. In terms of explanation of erosion, the greatest need is for a full recognition of the importance of socio-economic drivers. The accession of new countries to the EU with different economic and land-use histories emphasises this need. Too often we have left people, especially the farmers, out of the picture. Our approach could be characterised as ‘data-rich and people-poor’.},

  abstract = {The pyrolysis of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) of the cultivar, “Cave-in-Rock” harvested at three stages of physiological maturity was studied in a PY–GC/MS system at the 600–1050°C temperature range. Under these conditions, the decomposition was complete within 20s yielding char, and two sets of pyrolysis gas, condensable and non-condensable. The former consisted of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and higher molecular weight compounds possibly from the hydroxyl group and from the methoxy groups of the cell wall components. The non-condensable gases were mainly CO, CO2 and C1–C3 hydrocarbons. For these, there was a 900°C temperature boundary where dramatic change occurred in their evolution rates. Below this temperature, CO2 decreased but CO and the C1–C3 hydrocarbons increased almost linearly with temperature. Above this temperature boundary, the hydrocarbons leveled off but there was a rapid rise in CO and CO2 evolution at a constant CO/CO2 ratio. These suggest the appearance of secondary or tertiary pyrolysis reactions involving rearrangement and release of CO and hydrocarbons prior to this temperature boundary and the release of CO and CO2 from the tightly bond oxygen functionalities including C–C bonds thereafter. At {$<$}750°C, there were modest increases in condensable gas yield and decrease in non-condensable gas due to differences in plant maturity at harvest. However, the effect of switchgrass physiological maturity on gas yield was statistically insignificant at high temperatures. The energy content of the non-condensable gas measured was about 68\% of the gross energy content of the biomass for the early harvest crop and 80\% for the mature crop. The activation energy for the decomposition, estimated assuming first order reaction kinetics, showed a linear increase with plant physiological maturity. The results demonstrate that physiological maturity at harvest of switchgrass biomass can result in different concentrations of pyrolysis products at different temperatures. These results also demonstrate the need for additional research with a broader array of herbaceous biomass materials to develop a better understanding of the synergies of crop cultivation, harvesting and processing of dedicated herbaceous biomass energy crops during their thermochemical conversion.},

The signal to noise of ELSD using DBM is about 10 times lower than that for TCB. However, the ELSD signal power exponent for DBM was measured as 1.35, which is much closer to unity than the value of 1.61 for TCB. After applying the required corrections to linearize the response of the ELSD signal as a function of concentration, similar average molecular weights to those measured in the interlaboratory study using DRI, were obtained for the analyzed resins.},

The linearity and reproducibility of response of the standards over a range of concentrations are reported. 1,3,5-Tri-tert.-butylbenzene was selected as the most appropriate among the tested standards to be used in Py–GC–MS of lignin.

Fractional pyrolysis under dynamic conditions of polypropylene performed at temperatures below the isothermal measurements reveal a decreasing amount of alkenes and alkanes and an increasing amount of dienes with temperature.

Thus, the objective of this study was to examine how the growth of two kinds of poplar planting materials, un-rooted cuttings and bare-rooted seedlings was influenced by different vegetation control and soil preparation practices. Across treatments, un-rooted cuttings grew more rapidly than the bare-rooted seedlings. Our results also show that mulching with a degradable carpet or permanent polyethylene plastic increased seedling growth to a similar extent and more strongly in the cases of no treatment (in control plots). In addition, the results suggest that soil preparation in the mulched area favored seedling growth, but this effect was restricted to the first year after planting. These findings indicate that optimal practices for establishing poplar plantations on former agricultural land include planting un-rooted cuttings in prepared soil and mulching.},

  abstract = {The expansion of the sugar beet leaf canopy tends to be slow in the north of France. This is an important source of loss of yield. This study identifies the main sources of growth variability before competition starts between plants. Field plots were set up for different years and crop establishment conditions (soil types, sowing dates, plastic mulches, sowing depths, tillage operations, cultivars). Growth curves were obtained for each experimental treatment by sampling plants having the same emergence date and the same seedling size index. This index was obtained by measuring the length of the first leaf at a constant thermal time from emergence. Date were fitted to an exponential model in which time was expressed as a thermal time calculated from the emergence date and using soil temperatures. This calculation accounted for most of the differences between soil types, mulch conditions and emergence dates. Aerial biomass varied widely at the end of the exponential period. The variability of growth curves was mainly due to their intercept (W(o)), which was strongly correlated with the seedling size index. In 1987, the seedlings having the largest size at the beginning of the study period had a subsequent RGR which was significantly lower than the others. This could be due to a change in the exponential growth pattern in the latest part of the period studied. The average RGR obtained in 1987 were lower than those obtained in 1988, but the other experimental treatments influenced early growth only through the initial size of seedlings. When growth is not limited by soil nutritional factors, the wide variability in plant aerial biomass before competition is largely due to differences at the beginning of seedling growth, established before the 4-leaf stage.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is defined as the organic matter fraction in solution that passes through a 0.45 μm filter. Although DOM is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, it represents only a small proportion of the total organic matter in soil. However, DOM, being the most mobile and actively cycling organic matter fraction, influences a spectrum of biogeochemical processes in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Biological fixation of atmospheric CO2 during photosynthesis by higher plants is the primary driver of global carbon cycle. A major portion of the carbon in organic matter in the aquatic environment is derived from the transport of carbon produced in the terrestrial environment. However, much of the terrestrially produced DOM is consumed by microbes, photo degraded, or adsorbed in soils and sediments as it passes to the ocean. The majority of DOM in terrestrial and aquatic environments is ultimately returned to atmosphere as CO2 through microbial respiration, thereby renewing the atmospheric CO2 reserve for photosynthesis. Dissolved organic matter plays a significant role in influencing the dynamics and interactions of nutrients and contaminants in soils and microbial functions, thereby serving as a sensitive indicator of shifts in ecological processes. This chapter aims to highlight knowledge on the production of DOM in soils under different management regimes, identify its sources and sinks, and integrate its dynamics with various soil processes. Understanding the significance of DOM in soil processes can enhance development of strategies to mitigate DOM-induced environmental impacts. This review encourages greater interactions between terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemists and ecologists, which is essential for unraveling the fundamental biogeochemical processes involved in the synthesis of DOM in terrestrial ecosystem, its subsequent transport to aquatic ecosystem, and its role in environmental sustainability, buffering of nutrients and pollutants (metal(loid)s and organics), and the net effect on the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Suboptimal regimes of air and soil temperature usually occur under unheated greenhouses during winter crop cycles. This work analyses the effects of three soil surface treatments (no plastic mulch, NM; transparent mulch, TM, and black mulch, BM) on the air-soil heat exchanges and the resulting soil and aerial microclimate. Experiments were conducted in unheated greenhouse compartments located in an area of mild winter climate (South-East Spain) during autumn and winter periods. In all treatments, the soil consisted of an artificial layer of 0.10 m gravel-sand material placed above a 0.3 m layer of imported loamy soil. When vents were closed, soil heat flux, ground net radiation and both air and root-zone temperature were higher in BM than in TM, while NM presented intermediate performances between BM and TM. When vents were open, heat storage and soil warming were substantially reduced with respect to unventilated conditions. This reduction was greater in BM, and so the advantages of BM with respect to the other treatments were only marginal under ventilated conditions. The main conclusions were: (i) The combination of black mulch + greenhouse appears to be a simple and low-cost passive heating system that can be recommended for the early stages of crop cycles starting at the end of autumn or in winter, when canopy leaf area index is small and most of the soil surface is free of vegetation; and (ii) ventilation had a negative effect on the benefits of mulching, implying that greenhouse ventilation management should reflect a compromise between maximizing greenhouse heat storage and fulfilling ventilation requirements for suitable crop growth.

  abstract = {The application of soil solarization (SS), one of the most promising techniques for the control of soilborne pathogens, is seriously limited by the drawback regarding the disposal of the used plastic materials. A possible solution to this problem is the use of biodegradable plastics. The aim of this study was to make comparisons between the impact of SS performed with biodegradable materials and that of SS with plastic films and other pest management techniques (i.e. organic matter amendment, calcium cyanamide and Dazomet fungicide application) on crop productivity, soilborne disease incidence, weed suppression, and soil chemical (total N, NH(4)-N, nitrate, available phosphorus, organic matter, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate) and microbial (cultivable Pseudomonas, DGGE fingerprinting of bacterial 16S- and fungal 28S rRNA gene fragments from total soil community DNA) parameters. We carried out field experiments in two types of soil with different textures (clay and sand) artificially inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum Esp. lycopersici (vs. tomato) and Sclerotinia minor (vs. lettuce). The temperature of soils covered with solarizing materials was always higher than that of bare soils, but plastic cover was more effective and consistent in rising soil temperature compared to biodegradable materials. Plant growth promotion by SS was limited, especially compared to Dazomet and organic matter applications, and a positive effect was observed only for lettuce in the clay soil. Differently, both plastic and biodegradable solarizing materials were effective in reducing lettuce drop caused by S. minor. Weed development was significantly suppressed by Dazomet application and SS with plastic film, while control with biodegradable materials was limited. SS had a variable and limited effect on chemical and microbial parameters, with a general tendency to reduce richness of bacteria and fungi. Dazomet caused the most pronounced reduction of the microbial community diversity in both soil types and a significant stimulation of the fluorescent Pseudomonas group. Organic amendment significantly enhanced the organic matter content, the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate and the Pseudomonas population. Among all measured soil parameters, the size of the fluorescent Pseudomonas population emerged as the most important factor affecting crop productivity. The results of this experimentation show the potential of using biodegradable solarizing materials in place of plastic films, but also indicate the need for improving their properties to obtain performances comparable to those of other pest management techniques.

  abstract = {Concern about potential increases in weed populations without the use of herbicides has limited the uptake of organic farming. However, as both public demands for organic produce and the profile of organic farming have increased in recent years, so too has the range of weed control options. Progress in cultural methods of weed control has included the use of novel weed-suppressing cover crops, and the identification of specific crop traits for weed suppression. Direct weed control has also seen developments, with new implements appearing on the market that could benefit in the future from sophisticated machine guidance and weed detection technology. Advances in novel techniques such as steaming have also been made. Many weed control operations in organic systems present the grower with conflicts, and both these and many of the most recent developments in organic weed control are reviewed. An increase in our understanding of weed biology and population dynamics underpins long-term improvements in sustainable weed control. The outcome of these studies will benefit conventional and organic growers alike. Emphasis is given to the need for flexibility and a combination of weed biology knowledge, cultural methods and direct weed control to maintain weed populations at manageable levels.},

Initial biofilm formation was followed by fluorescence microscopy and the subsequent growth of bacteria on the surface of the plastic was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that microbial growth occurred on the presence of PE samples that had been compression moulded to thick sections but had not been deliberately pre-oxidised. Molecular enlargement and broadening of molecular weight distribution occurred after preheating in air at 60~°C but not at ambient temperatures but colonisation of microorganisms occurred on all samples. Erosion of the film surface was observed in the vicinity of the microorganisms and the decay of oxidation products in the surface of the polymer film was measured by FTIR measurements and was found to be associated with the formation of protein and polysaccharides, attributable to the growth of the microorganisms.},

Soil ecosystems, particularly agricultural land, have been recognized as a major sink of microplastics, but the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems (e.g., above and below ground) remain largely unknown. In this study, different types of microplastics [biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA)], conventional high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and microplastic clothing fibers were added to soil containing the endogeic Aporrectodea rosea (rosy-tipped earthworm) and planted with Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) to assess the biophysical soil response in a mesocosm experiment. When exposed to fibers or PLA microplastics, fewer seeds germinated. There was also a reduction in shoot height with PLA. The biomass of A. rosea exposed to HDPE was significantly reduced compared to control samples. Furthermore, with HDPE present there was a decrease in soil pH. The size distribution of water-stable soil aggregates was altered when microplastics were present, suggesting potential alterations of soil stability. This study provides evidence that microplastics manufactured of HDPE and PLA, and synthetic fibers can affect the development of L. perenne, health of A. rosea and basic, but crucial soil properties, with potential further impacts on soil ecosystem functioning.},

Its origin has so far remained elusive and a number of indices, such as C-to-N-ratio, lignin concentration and other combinations of chemical constituents have been used as substitutes for quality. We suggest here that quality is the number of enzymatic steps required to release as carbon dioxide a carbon atom from an organic compound. The larger the number of steps the lower is the quality of the carbon atom. Such a measure connects quality to thermodynamics. It also explains the rapid decrease in decomposition rate with decreasing quality suggested in the q-theory of organic matter dynamics and shows that the decomposition rate of low quality substrates has a stronger temperature dependence than that of high quality substrates.},

Combining the versatility of thermal analysis and the accuracy and sensitivity of mass spectrometry, this original method proves to be very useful for routine characterization of LLDPE.

Vegetation periods are frequently to be extended and frost damage to be avoided. Even the heat caused by mulching is aimed for the reduction of pathogens. For their optimal use, it is vital to know the effects to be expected of different types of mulch. The SVAT-model AMBETI (BRADEN, 1995), which has been routinely used in the agrometeorological. advisory service for a number of years, was modified and supplemented by a sub-model of energy balance and fluxes of the mulch in order to determine microclimate under the mulch. Following a short overview of the model AMBETI, the supplemented model components related to the modification of the incident short-wave and long-wave radiation, the energy balance of the mulch and the aerodynamic transport, as well as the coupling with the ordinary SVAT-model, are described. Modelled and measured air temperature and humidity below the mulch, as well as soil temperatures are presented as results. While there is still room to improve the parameterisations of the aerodynamic transports, the main effects of different types of mulch, namely punched mulch, two layers of punched mulch and fleece are modelled in accordance with the corresponding measurements. This is the pre-condition for the use of the model for advisory purposes.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is a defining environmental contaminant and is considered to be one of the greatest environmental threats of the Anthropocene, with its presence documented across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of this plastic debris falls into the micro (1\,μm–5\,mm) or nano (1–1000\,nm) size range and comes from primary and secondary sources. Its small size makes it cumbersome to isolate and analyze reproducibly, and its ubiquitous distribution creates numerous challenges when controlling for background contamination across matrices (e.g., sediment, tissue, water, air). Although research on microplastics represents a relatively nascent subfield, burgeoning interest in questions surrounding the fate and effects of these debris items creates a pressing need for harmonized sampling protocols and quality control approaches. For results across laboratories to be reproducible and comparable, it is imperative that guidelines based on vetted protocols be readily available to research groups, many of which are either new to plastics research or, as with any new subfield, have arrived at current approaches through a process of trial-and-error rather than in consultation with the greater scientific community. The goals of this manuscript are to (i) outline the steps necessary to conduct general as well as matrix-specific quality assurance and quality control based on sample type and associated constraints, (ii) briefly review current findings across matrices, and (iii) provide guidance for the design of sampling regimes. Specific attention is paid to the source of microplastic pollution as well as the pathway by which contamination occurs, with details provided regarding each step in the process from generating appropriate questions to sampling design and collection.},

  abstract = {Microplastic (MP) contamination in agricultural soils has recently gained attention in science and society. The continuous plastic waste generation and its low degradation rates indicate a cumulative effect of MP in the environment that calls for more research on the amounts and impacts of this contaminant. The most discussed agricultural sources for MP contamination of cropland are sewage sludge, compost, and plasticulture residues. However, knowledge about how much MP has been emitted into agricultural soils is scarce. Since MP distribution in soils is expected to be highly heterogeneous, its analysis in field samples provides mainly point information. To quantify the various MP sources and pathways within and across ecosystems, data-driven models represent crucial tools to scale these analytic results to a landscape level and to simulate effects of mitigation measures. Some recent modelling studies have estimated MP emissions based on production and consumption statistics at national level, but as of yet, spatially explicit regional quantification of microplastic emissions into agricultural soils are virtually missing in the scientific literature. Using data on MP analysis results from the literature in combination with national and regional statistics on sewage sludge, compost and organic waste production, as well as speciality cropping areas, we estimated the spatial distributions of cumulative MP mass inputs into agricultural soils in Germany. Although these estimates are based on limited data availability, our results provide first indications about locations where detailed soil analysis could be useful to investigate in situ processes and impacts. The methodology can be applied to other regions and continuously adapted when more knowledge on relevant sources, transport, accumulation, and degradation rates of MP in soils is gained in the future.},

These indices from experimentally weathered particles were compared to microplastic particles collected from oceanic surface waters in the California Current, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transition region between the two, in order to estimate the exposure time of the oceanic plastics. Although chemical bonds exhibited some nonlinear changes with environmental exposure, they can potentially approximate the weathering time of some plastics, especially high-density polyethylene. The majority of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre polyethylene particles we measured have inferred exposure times{$>$}18months, with some {$>$}30months.

PE was deployed in the Outer Oslofjord (Norway) for 21 days, before exposing the mussels to both virgin (PE-V) and weathered PE (PE-W) particles. The mussels ingested both types of particles, but significantly more weathered particles were ingested than virgin (p = .0317), based on PE dosed by weight (mg ml−1) but not when considering particle number (PE-V: 1.18 ± 0.16 particles ml−1; PE-W 1.86 ± 0.66 particles ml-1;). PE particle ingestion resulted in structural changes to the gills and digestive gland, as well as necrosis in other tissues such as the mantle. No differences were found regarding the degree of tissue alteration between PE-virgin and PE-weathered exposures. This current study illustrates the importance of using weathered particles in microplastic exposure studies to reflect the behaviour of plastic particles after entering the marine environment. The observed tissue alterations demonstrate the potential adverse effects to mussels exposed to microplastic particles.},

  abstract = {To maintain and improve soil fertility, compost application is a widely recommended practice. We hypothesized that this practice is, however, also a main entry path for plastic into soil. Hence, we i) quantified the prevalence of plastic in eight composts from different composting plants and hardware stores to derive estimations about related plastic inputs into soil, and ii) characterized the properties of these plastic residues in regard to size and shape for further risk assessment. Plastic remains were analyzed via density separation (ZnCl2) and light microscopy. Testing this method recovered 80~±~29\% of spiked plastic items. Applying this method revealed that all composts contained plastic particles in detectable amounts, with contents ranging from 12~±~8 to 46~±~8 particles kg−1, corresponding to calculated plastic weights of 0.05~±~0.08 to 1.36~±~0.59~g~kg−1. Because of this high variability, an a-priori discrimination of plastic loads between compost types cannot be achieved. Upscaling these loads to common recommendations in composting practice, which range from 7 to 35~t compost ha−1, suggest that compost application to agricultural fields goes along with plastic loads of 84,000 to 1,610,000 plastic items ha−1 per year (a), respectively, amounting to 0.34 to 47.53~kg plastic ha−1 a−1. Large potential inputs should thus also occur for horticultural soils, where application rates of compost usually vary between 6.48 and 19.44~t~ha−1, therewith resulting in a minimum plastic contamination of 77,770 plastic items and 0.31~kg plastic ha−1 a−1, but a maximum amount of up to 894,240 plastic items and 26.4~kg plastic ha−1 a−1. We conclude that compost application must be considered as potential source of plastic for both agricultural and horticultural soils, and technical solutions are needed to minimize these contamination risks while continuing this practice as important option to secure soil health.},

  abstract = {The permanent presence of microplastics in the marine environment is considered a global threat to several marine animals. Heavy metals and microplastics are typically included in two different classes of pollutants but the interaction between these two stressors is poorly understood. During 14 days of experimental manipulation, we examined the adsorption of two heavy metals, copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), leached from an antifouling paint to virgin polystyrene (PS) beads and aged polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fragments in seawater. We demonstrated that heavy metals were released from the antifouling paint to the water and both microplastic types adsorbed the two heavy metals. This adsorption kinetics was described using partition coefficients and mathematical models. Partition coefficients between pellets and water ranged between 650 and 850 for Cu on PS and PVC, respectively. The adsorption of Cu was significantly greater in PVC fragments than in PS, probably due to higher surface area and polarity of PVC. Concentrations of Cu and Zn increased significantly on PVC and PS over the course of the experiment with the exception of Zn on PS. As a result, we show a significant interaction between these types of microplastics and heavy metals, which can have implications for marine life and the environment. These results strongly support recent findings where plastics can play a key role as vectors for heavy metal ions in the marine system. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of monitoring marine litter and heavy metals, mainly associated with antifouling paints, particularly in the framework of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).},

Besides the general waste burden in waterbodies, (micro)plastic debris gives rise to ecological and social problems. Related to marine ecosystems, these problems are already in the center of interest of science, policy, and public. The United Nations Environment Programme, for instance, drafted a joint report on “marine plastic debris and microplastics,” and the European Community included the issue into the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, descriptor 10 “marine litter.”However, (micro)plastic litter in freshwater systems is not yet explicitly addressed in the respective regulations, although the issue is relevant for many international and national policy instruments and initiatives. Many conventions, agreements, regulations, strategies, action plans, programs, and guidelines refer to “all wastes” in general. This should also concern (micro)plastic waste.This chapter provides an overview of the regulatory instruments developed at different levels to address freshwater (micro)plastic litter. Beyond that, specific management options and measures that are either compulsory or voluntary are presented. Nevertheless, only few options have been realized so far. Reasons are numerous, first and foremost the lack of consensus on the definition of microplastics.The complexity of these particulate stressors with very heterogeneous physicochemical characteristics poses new challenges for regulation and management. We highlight the most important questions from the perspective of freshwater monitoring. Furthermore, we discuss a possible adaption of existing environmental policy instruments and potential management options for single categories of (micro)plastics.},

  abstract = {Bio-based, biodegradable in soil, as well as degradable polyethylene mulching films with pro-oxidants, have been introduced in the market in an effort to deal with the serious problem of managing plastic waste streams generated from conventional mulching films. In a previous experimental investigation, a series of naturally degraded under water melon cultivation conditions linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) mulching films with pro-oxidants, buried in the field for 8.5 years, were recovered intact even though undergoing a continuous slow abiotic degradation in soil. The aim of the present article was to simulate the behavior of the LLDPE mulching films with pro-oxidants under a much longer time-scale (e.g. some decades). Toward this purpose, samples of LLDPE with pro-oxidants film were artificially degraded to simulate severe degradation/fragmentation of these films while been buried in the soil for many years, following the end of the cultivation season. Further degradation of these severely degraded samples was investigated by burying them in the soil over a period of seven years. During this burial period, all degradation parameters and their evolution with time were measured. The artificially degraded LLDPE film samples with pro-oxidants, in contrast to the naturally degraded film that remained intact for 8.5 years, were gradually transformed into tiny micro-fragments in the soil. These fragments, through a continuing abiotic degradation process under natural soil conditions are eventually transformed into invisible micro-fragments. The fate of these micro-fragments and their long-term impact to the environment and human health is unpredictable. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 42289.},

The environmental conditions during storage and usage of these materials strongly influence their mechanical properties and behaviour. Ageing and degradation during the useful lifetime of biodegradable agricultural films causes losses in the mechanical performance of the material, as measured by monitoring the evolution of some of the critical mechanical properties. Such losses may be comparable to the corresponding losses of the conventional polyethylene agricultural films due to ageing, or they may be more drastic. In the present paper, the overall mechanical and ageing/degradation behaviour of experimental specially designed and manufactured low-tunnel and mulching biodegradable films, exposed to full-scale field conditions is analysed. Selected critical mechanical properties of these films manufactured with different grades of Mater-Bi material and additives, different thickness and processing schemes and exposed to real cultivation conditions in four different locations in Europe are investigated in the laboratory and compared against the corresponding behaviour of conventional agricultural films at various stages of their exposure time.},

As a result, their physical and chemical properties differ from those of the pure polymers often used for in vitro enzymatic and microbial degradation studies, raising questions about the biodegradation capability of mulch films. Currently, standards exist for the biodegradation of plastics in composting conditions but not in soil. Biodegradation in soil or compost depends on a complex synergy of biological and abiotic degradative processes. This review discusses the physicochemical and structural properties of biodegradable plastic mulches, examines their potential for on-site decomposition in light of site-to-site variance due to environmental and biological conditions, and considers the potential for long-term effects on agroecosystem sustainability and functionality.},

  abstract = {Soil structure exerts important influences on the edaphic conditions and the environment. It is often expressed as the degree of stability of aggregates. Aggregation results from the rearrangement, flocculation and cementation of particles. It is mediated by soil organic carbon (SOC), biota, ionic bridging, clay and carbonates. The complex interactions of these aggregants can be synergistic or disruptive to aggregation. Clay-sized particles are commonly associated with aggregation by rearrangement and flocculation, although swelling clay can disrupt aggregates. Organo-metallic compounds and cations form bridges between particles. The SOC originates from plants, animals and microorganisms, and their exudates. It enhances aggregation through the bonding of primary soil particles. The effectiveness of SOC in forming stable aggregates is related to its decomposition rate, which in turn is influenced by its physical and chemical protection from microbial action. Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) increases aggregation in arid and semi-arid environments, and the formation of secondary carbonates is influenced by the presence of SOC and Ca2+ and Mg2+. Soil biota release CO2 and form SOC which increase dissolution of primary carbonates while cations increase precipitation of secondary carbonates. The precipitation of (hydr)oxides, phosphates and carbonates enhances aggregation. Cations such as Si4+, Fe3+, Al3+ and Ca2+ stimulate the precipitation of compounds that act as bonding agents for primary particles. Roots and hyphae can enmesh particles together while realigning them and releasing organic compounds that hold particles together, a process with a positive impact on soil C sequestration. Soil structure can be significantly modified through management practices and environmental changes. Practices that increase productivity and decrease soil disruption enhance aggregation and structural development.},

  abstract = {Plastics are now widespread in the natural environment. Due to their size, microplastics (MPs; defined as particles {$<$}5~mm) in particular, have the potential to cause damage and harm to organisms and may lead to a potential loss of ecosystem services. Research has demonstrated the significant impact of MPs on aquatic systems; however, little is known about their effects on the terrestrial environment, particularly within agroecosystems, the cornerstone of global food production. Soil biology is highly responsive to environmental perturbation and change. Hereby, we investigated the effect of pure low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MP loading (0, 100, 1000, or 10000~kg~ha−1) on soil and plant biological health in a field environment over a cropping season. Our results showed that MP loading had no significant effect (p~{$>~$}0.05) on the soil bacterial community diversity (as measured by amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene), the size and structure of the PLFA-derived soil microbial community, or the abundance and biomass of earthworms. In addition, metabolomic profiling revealed no dose-dependent effect of MP loading on soil biogenic amine concentrations. The growth and yield of wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Mulika) were also unaffected by MP dose, even at extremely high (≥1000~kg~ha−1) loading levels. Nitrogen (N) cycling gene abundance before and after N fertiliser application on the MP loaded experimental plots showed relatively little change, although further experimentation is suggested, with similar trends evident for soil nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Overall, we illustrate that MPs themselves may not pose a significant problem in the short term (days to months), due to their recalcitrant nature. We also emphasise that most MPs in the environment are not pure or uncontaminated, containing additives (e.g. plasticisers, pigments and stabilisers) that are generally not chemically bound to the plastic polymer and may be prone to leaching into the soil matrix. Understanding the effect of additives on soil biology as well as the longer-term (years to decades) impact of MPs on soil biological and ecological health in the field environment is recommended.},

  abstract = {To investigate the storage relationships between and production of organic matter in tropical forests and climate, data on forest biomass, soil organic matter, litter storage, primary production, and litterfall were surveyed from the literature and organized using the Holdridge Life Zone system of classification. Ordinary least squares regressions were applied to all the data sets using the ratio of temperature to precipitation (T/P) as an index to climate and the independent variable. Total forest biomass (40-538 t/ha) gave a significant inverted U-shaped relationship with T/P, with peak values in the tropical moist forest life zone and lower ones in wetter and drier forest life zones. Soil carbon content (24-599 t C/ha) decreased exponentially and significantly with increasing T/P (i.e., from wet to dry forest life zones). No significant relationship was found between litter storage and T/P. Gross primary production (19-120 t/ha yr) decreased exponentially and significantly with increasing T/P. Neither net primary production (11-21 t/ha yr) nor wood production (1-11 t/ha yr) were related to T/P. The ratio of leaf litter production to net primary production (0.25-0.65) was inversely related to T/P, suggesting different strategies of allocation of the net primary production in different life zones. The relationship between total litterfall (1.0-15.3 t/ha yr, excluding large wood) and T/P was significant and its shape similar to that obtained for biomass versus T/P; litterfall was highest in tropical moist forest life zones and lower in wetter or drier ones. The linear relationship between biomass and litterfall suggested that the turnover time of biomass in mature tropical forests is similar for all life zones, and is of the order of 34 yr. To determine the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle, literature estimates of areas of tropical forests were placed into six life zone groupings. The total tropical and subtropical basal and altitudinal forest area of 1838 million ha was comprised of 42 percent dry forest, 33 percent moist forest, and 25 percent wet and rain forest life zone groups. Organic-matter storage data were also combined into the six life zone groups and the means for each group calculated. The product of forest areas in the six groups and the mean organic matter per unit area in the groups yielded a total storage of 787 billion t organic matter, with vegetation accounting for 58, soils 41, and litter 1 percent. About half of the total storage was located in the tropical basal wet, moist, and dry forest life zone groups. Litterfall data were treated in the same way as organic-matter storage, resulting in a total litter production in tropical forests of 12.3 billion t organic matter/yr. Most litter was produced in the tropical basal moist forest group (30\%) and least in the tropical basal dry forest group (10\%). Turnover time of litter in tropical forests was less than 1 yr. Lowest turnover times were in very wet (1 yr) and in dry (0.9-1.9 yr) life zone groups. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle because they store 46 percent of the world's living terrestrial carbon pool and 11 percent of the world's soil carbon pool.},

  abstract = {Moisture dynamics can favour the formation of stable soil structure by reorientation of soil particles and their gluing by organic structures. While soils are naturally exposed to moisture dynamics, structural stabilization is rather low if the soil organic matter (SOM) or clay content is insufficient. Although it is accepted that hydrogel-forming, swellable organic substances can enhance structural stabilization, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood due to the lack of appropriate testing methods. The objective of our study was to understand the impact of soil moisture dynamics on the swelling properties of an incorporated hydrogel and their implications for soil structural properties. A physically unstable, silty sand soil was treated with polyacrylic acid (PAA) as highly swellable model polymer and subjected either to drying/remoistening cycles or to constant moisture. At certain measurement points, we investigated swelling processes and water binding using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry (1H NMR relaxometry) in order to characterize the state of water entrapped in the hydrogel and soil pores and combined this information with rheological characteristics of the soil sample. Contrary to the untreated soil, the polymer-treated soil revealed both higher deformation (γ) at the yield point and higher maximum shear stress (τmax), which reacted dynamically, but not reversibly on moisture dynamics and water redistribution. Structural stability clearly increased with the proportion of PAA-associated water assessed by 1H NMR relaxometry. This relation suggests that swelling–shrinking processes in the hydrogel could explain the hysteretic and time-dependent nature of hydrogel-induced soil structural stabilization. All in all, the combination of 1H NMR relaxometry and rheology will help to investigate mechanisms governing the development of soil structural stability and SOM-associated water in dependence of environmental dynamics.},

Terrestrial soils are widely contaminated by MPs due to the application of sewage sludge and wastewater, plastic mulching, littering, the input of tire wear from roads and atmospheric deposition. Within the last decade, an increasing number of individual studies focused on item counts and masses of MPs in different global soil environments.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We reviewed these studies to achieve a representative picture of common degrees of contamination. The majority of the prospected agricultural and horticultural sites were exposed to sewage sludge and mulching film application and showed concentrations of \&lt;13 000 items kg\textsuperscript{−1} dry soil and 4.5 mg kg\textsuperscript{−1} dry soil. Microplastic concentrations in soils in the vicinity of municipal areas were thereby 10 times larger compared to rural sites. The measurement of masses was generally underrepresented compared to item numbers, and mass data were often generated from microscopic analyses by using shape-to-mass models instead of direct measurements. Extreme values, such as on industrial sites, exceed the common concentrations by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude, which might be attributed not only to the land use but also to the applied methods of measurement. Campaigns that focus on other entry pathways like composts, road dust runoff and littering or land uses like grassland, forest, fallow and wilderness as well as industrial sites and landfills were underrepresented or nonexistent. Background loads, such as atmospheric deposition, were often not excluded from the measurements and, thus, the studies might overestimate the contribution of the analyzed entry pathway to the total load. Other studies focused on light density MP, e.g., from mulching films, and therefore underestimated the amount of soil MP.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Despite these limitations, the data give an impression of the spectrum of global MP concentrations and are a good basis for experiments examining the effects of MPs on exposed soils.

Mass concentrations of plastic particles as found in highly contaminated soils were shown to weaken the soil structure by reducing the proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA). In addition, parts of the edaphon are adversely affected by mainly the \&lt;\&thinsp;100\&thinsp;\&micro;m microplastic fraction. The specific interaction of soil microplastic with other particulate organic matter (POM) and the mineral phase during the formation of soil aggregates as well as the adverse effects of especially the small-sized fraction, which has low weight but high specific surface area, justify a focus on surface properties of the soil microplastic and their alteration during the plastic life cycle. Exposed to UV radiation, juvenile plastic undergoes photochemical weathering with embrittlement and the formation of surface charge. When plastic particles enter the soil environment, a second step takes place, that includes biogeochemical weathering with enzymes, biotic and abiotic acids, oxidants as well as bioturbation and feeding of soil fauna. This work integrates recent findings on the effects of microplastic on soil structure and biota, the genesis of its surface characteristics and discusses how to reproduce them to conduct laboratory experiments with close-to-nature designer microplastic.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

It has recently also been used for the extraction of microplastic from soil samples. However, the investigation of POM physiochemical properties and ecological functions might be biased if particles are comminuted during the treatment. In this work, different types of POM, which are representative of different terrestrial ecosystems and anthropogenic influences, were tested for their structural stability in the face of ultrasonication in the range of 0 to 500 J mL\textsuperscript{−1}. The occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM) of an agricultural and forest soil as well as pyrochar showed a significant reduction of particle size at ≥50 J mL\textsuperscript{−1} by an average factor of 1.37±0.16 and a concurrent reduction of recovery rates by an average of 21.7±10.7 \% when being extracted. Our results imply that increasing ultrasonication causes increasing retention of POM within the sedimenting phase, leading to a misinterpretation of certain POM fractions as more strongly bound oPOM or part of the mineral-associated organic matter (MOM). This could, for example, lead to a false estimation of physical stabilization. In contrast, neither fresh nor weathered polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) microplastics showed a reduction of particle size or the recovery rate after application of ultrasound. We conclude that ultrasonication applied to soils has no impact on microplastic size distribution and thus provides a valuable tool for the assessment of microplastics in soils and soil aggregates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Further properties of plastic such as aging, coating and additives have been insufficiently documented.

Most research into the distribution of microplastics has focused on water but here we show that wind transport can be very effective in mobilising microplastic particles. A series of wind tunnel experiments using two different substrates (sand and soil), two different microplastics (microbeads and fibres) and 5 different concentrations of microplastics (ranging from 0~mg kg−1dw to 1040~mg kg−1dw) is used to demonstrate that microplastics are preferentially transported by wind compared to sand and soil. When compared to either of the untreated substrate beds (0~mg kg−1dw), the inclusion of microplastics was not found to significantly affect the wind erosion threshold for any of the concentrations or geometric forms (fibres or beads) tested. Averaged over all concentrations of microplastics and both substrate types, microplastic enrichment was lower for microbeads than fibres. The enrichment of microplastic fibres within the entrained particulate matter was one to two orders of magnitude higher for both test bed substrates, ranging from 98 to 498 for the sand and 278 to 726 for the soil. This suggests microplastic shape needs to be carefully parameterized in models of atmospheric microplastic transport. We suggest that microplastic research could benefit from previous investigations into the wind erosion of soil organic carbon.},

Thus, while biodegradability is seen as an opportunity to fight against long-term littering it may also risk aggravating the problem of littering further and potentially increase environmental impacts. Subsequently there are different views across Europe about the ecological benefit of biodegradable plastics and different approaches in dealing with biodegradable plastic wastes that exist. Considering this background, the aim of the project was to identify and compare different strategies and treatment approaches for biodegradable plastics within the Member States of the European Union. The focus, primarily, being on the approaches of Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.},

  abstract = {There is increasing scientific and public concern over the presence of microplastics in the natural environment. We present the results of a systematic review of the literature to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality and more holistic monitoring studies alongside more environmentally realistic effects studies. Only then will we be able to fully characterize risks of microplastics to the environment to support the introduction of regulatory controls that can make a real positive difference to environmental quality.

Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N2O fluxes at the soil–atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) have increased our understanding of N2O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N2O (and N2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N2O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use.}

The aggregation of NPs under various environmental conditions has not yet been studied. We investigated the influences of inorganic ions and natural organic matter (NOM) on polystyrene (PS) NPs aggregation in solutions. Results showed that PS NPs remained stable in wide ionic strength solutions of NaCl (1–100 mM) and CaCl2 (0.1–15 mM), and only in low ionic strength FeCl3 solutions (0.01 mM). However, obvious PS NPs aggregation was observed in FeCl3 solutions with an increase in ionic strength (0.1 and 1 mM). Moreover, NOM had a negligible effect on PS NPs aggregation in all ionic strengths of NaCl and CaCl2 solutions and in low ionic strength FeCl3 solutions (0.01 mM). However, NOM reduced PS NPs aggregation in an intermediate ionic strength FeCl3 (0.1 mM) solution and increased aggregation in a high ionic strength FeCl3 (1 mM) solution. Based on the theoretical analysis of interaction forces among PS NPs, the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek force was a contributor governing PS NPs aggregation either in the absence or presence of NOM. In addition, other factors, including electrostatic heterogeneity of PS NPs surfaces, steric repulsion induced by NOM, and clusters formed via bridging effect in the presence of NOM also contributed to altered PS NPs aggregation under selected conditions. The PS NPs-NOM clusters were directly observed using a cryogenic scanning electron microscope.},

In particular, microplastics that are mainly degraded from larger plastic debris have become a growing environmental concern. However, studies on the degradation of plastics in the aquatic environment that hydrobios reside in have been limited, while several studies regarding the degradation of plastics have been conducted under outdoor or accelerated weathering conditions. Thus, observation of the degradation of three types of virgin plastic pellets exposed to UV irradiation in three different environments (i.e., simulated seawater, ultrapure water, and a waterless (air) condition) was carried out. Data on the changes in physical and chemical properties were collected. The FTIR spectra showed that hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups developed in three types of weathered plastic pellets under the air and ultrapure water environmental conditions after 3months of UV irradiation, while only carbonyl groups were found in plastic pellets in the simulated seawater environment. In contrast, the Raman spectra showed no significant changes in the weathered plastic pellets, but there were different intensities of characteristic peaks after exposure to UV irradiation. In addition, SEM images illustrated that granular oxidation, cracks and flakes were common patterns during degradation, and the plastic pellets in the three different environments experienced different levels of chemical weathering. We suggest that further studies on the degradation processes of plastic debris are needed to predict the fate of plastic debris in the environment.},

The results indicated different cultivar tolerance to DBP. DBP concentration in the shoots of the cultivars and residual DBP concentration in the soil were proportional to initial DBP concentrations in the soil and significantly different with different genotypic cultivars, indicating that the removal of DBP is cultivar-specific. DBP removal in the soil with indigenous DBP was higher than that in freshly DBP-spiked soils. The cultivars of local white-skin I. aquatica (cultivar V5) and Taiwan filiform-leaf I. aquatica (cultivar V1) presented the highest phytoremediation potential in the soil containing indigenous DBP and in freshly DBP-spiked soil, respectively. The translocation factor (TF, DBP concentration ratio of the shoots to the roots) and bioconcentration factor (BCF, DBP concentration ratio of the plant to the soil) also significantly varied with different cultivars, and they did not follow distribution profiles correlated to DBP removal indicating that phytoextraction was not the dominant DBP removal mechanism. Finally, the potential ability of different cultivars of enhancing biodegradation varied widely.},

The current knowledge concerning poorly known diffuse sources of MPs pollution in terrestrial ecosystems have been considered in this work. In addition, a particular focus on the presence, mechanism of absorption and effects of MPs in plants has also been provided. Research concerning microplastics in urban areas and their intake by Tyre and Road Wear Particulates (TWRP) demonstrated a high contribution of this plastic debris to microplastic pollution, although quantification of these inputs is challenging to assess because studies are still very few. Around 50\% of particles are expected to remain in the roadside soil, while the rest is transported away by the runoff with high concentrations of TRWP with a size ranging between 0.02 and 0.1~mm. Natural and anthropic environments like temporary ponds, stormwater retention ponds and small waterbodies were considered sensitive connecting ecosystems rich in biodiversity between terrestrial and aquatic environments. Even if studies are not yet exhaustive and just eight studies were currently published concerning these ecosystems, considerable values of MPs were already observed both in the sediment and water phase of ponds. Although still poorly explored, agricultural environments were already demonstrated to hide a significant number of microplastics linked mainly to agricultural activities and practices (e.g. mulch, sewage and compost fertilisation). However, the microplastics transportation processes into the soil are still understudied, and a few works are available. Microplastics and primarily nanoplastics presence was also observed in common edible plants (fruit and vegetables) with alarming Estimated Daily Intakes ranging from 2.96~×~1004 to 4.62~×~1005 (p kg−1~day−1) for adults depending on species. In addition, adverse effects on plants growth, photosynthetic activity, antioxidant system and nutritional values of several common fruits and vegetables were also demonstrated by several studies.},

The lack of consistent and standardised methods and protocols used to evaluate and quantify microplastics present in riverine systems made a comparison among different studies a critical issue. Based on literature research and the practical expertise of the authors, this work presents a complete collection and analysis of procedures concerning the monitoring of microplastics in riverine environments, focusing on their sampling and analytical protocols to identify, quantify, and characterise them. Further details regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each analytical technique described, such as general recommendations and suggestions, are provided to give practical support for analytical procedures. In particular, microplastics studies consist firstly of their sampling from the aquatic compartment (aqueous and solid phase). Based on the goal of the research, specific devices can be used to collect particles from different matrices. It follows their quantification after extraction from the environmental matrix, adopting different protocols to isolate microplastics from a large amount of organic matter present in a riverine system. In the end, additional qualitative analyses (e.g., RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy, GC-MS) are required to identify the chemical composition of particles for a better image regarding the abundance of polymer types, their origin, or other information related to manufacturing processes.},

One of the main MP reservoirs is sludge generated during wastewater treatment. Estimates suggest that, through sludge settling, treatment processes remove between 80 and 90 \% of MP present in wastewater. Nevertheless, reliable measurements of actual plastics loads retained by sludge are still lacking for management purposes. Hence, our goal was to validate a quick method for MP quantitation in sludge. Recovery tests were conducted with red low-density polyethylene (LDPE) fragments whose sizes ranged between 5 to 1 mm, 1 to 0.5 mm and 500 to 150 μm. For each size fraction, either 10 or 100 LDPE fragments were spiked into wet sludge (50 mL). Subsequent LDPE analysis involved steps such as freeze-drying, sieving, Fenton purification, visual shorting and FTIR identification. When expressed as number of fragments, quantitative (i.e. percentage values between 80 and 100) were obtained regardless of size fraction or initial spiked number. In terms of total spiked LDPE weight, however, recoveries consistently exceeded 100 \% because LDPE fragments retained other materials. Such residues contributed to an overestimation of MP by weight up to 33 \% of the 500−150 μm fraction. •Method was validated by spiking LDPE fragments.•Recoveries based on MP number showed good precision and accuracy.•Residues attached to MP resulted in overestimated recoveries by MP weight up to 33 \%.},

It is imperative to understand occurrence and distribution of microplastics in soils.

Microplastics were isolated from all the samples and all depths (0–80 cm). The microplastics abundance in soils ranged from 4.94 items/kg to 252.70 items/kg, with an average of 37.32 items/kg. The most common microplastic type detected was Polypropylene (PP) occurring as white fragments with sizes ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. Abiotic parameters such as soil pH and texture were the general factors being associated with microplastic abundance. Meantime, traffic was indicated as one important factor to affect the microplastic abundance. Overall, the road input seems to be the main source of microplastic pollution in agricultural areas along the Yangtze River and estuary. Further studies should elucidate the original of the plastic fragments in order to establish a baseline for regulative initiatives securing environmental protection.},

The ability of S.~palustre to intercept and retain polystyrene, and the effects of vitality and post-exposure washing on NP retention by moss were tested. Fluorescence microscope observations showed that polystyrene NPs were retained by moss leaves in form of small (the most abundant fraction) and large aggregates. Particle count analysis highlighted that the number of particles increased while increasing the exposure time. Moreover, moss devitalization favored NP accumulation, likely because of cell membrane damages occurred in dead moss material. Post-exposure washing induced a loss of larger aggregates, suggesting that exposure time is a key point to be carefully evaluated in field conditions. These results encourage the use of S.~palustre transplants for monitoring microplastics contamination of fresh water environments.},

  abstract = {As plant roots take up water and the soil dries, water depletion is expected to occur in the vicinity of roots, the so called rhizosphere. However, recent experiments showed that the rhizosphere of lupines was wetter than the bulk soil during the drying period. Surprisingly, the rhizosphere remained temporarily dry after irrigation. Such water dynamics in the rhizosphere can be explained by the drying/wetting dynamics of mucilage exuded by roots. The capacity of mucilage to hold large volumes of water at negative water potential may favor root water uptake. However, mucilage hydrophobicity after drying may temporarily limit the local water uptake after irrigation. The effects of such rhizosphere dynamics are not yet understood. In particular, it is not known how the rhizosphere dynamics vary along roots and as a function of soil water content. My hypothesis was that the rewetting rate of the rhizosphere is primarily function of root age. Neutron radiography was used to monitor how the rhizosphere water dynamics vary along the root systems of lupines during drying/wetting cycles of different duration. The radiographs showed a fast and almost immediate rewetting of the rhizosphere of the distal root segments, in contrast to a slow rewetting of the rhizosphere of the proximal segments. The rewetting rate of the rhizosphere was not function of the water content before irrigation, but it was function of time. It is concluded that rhizosphere hydrophobicity is not uniform along roots, but it covers only the older and proximal root segments, while the young root segments are hydraulically well-connected to the soil. I included these rhizosphere dynamics in a microscopic model of root water uptake. In the model, the relation between water content and water potential in the rhizosphere is not unique and it varies over time, and the rewetting rate of the rhizosphere decreases with time. The rhisosphere variability seems an optimal adaptation strategy to increase the water uptake of young root segments, which possibly reached new available water, and partly disconnect the old root segments from the already depleted soil.},

Treatments consisted of ammonium nitrate (control), hairy vetch cover crop, hairy vetch cover crop and poultry manure compost (10 Mg/ha), three levels of poultry manure compost (5, 10, and 20 Mg/ha), and two levels of poultry manure (2.5 and 5 Mg/ha). Black polyethylene mulch was used in all treatments without hairy vetch. Fatty acid analysis was used to characterize the total soil microbial community structure, while two substrate utilization assays were used to investigate the community structure of culturable bacteria and fungi. Crop yield was not significantly increased by hairy vetch cover cropping when compared to black polyethylene mulch, although microbial community structure was significantly affected by cover cropping. Under black polyethylene mulch, crop yields were significantly increased by the highest levels of compost and manure when compared to inorganic fertilizer, but there was no detectable effect on soil microbial community structure. When cover cropping was compared to organic amended plasticulture systems, crop yields were similar one year but dissimilar the next. However, hairy vetch cover cropping and organic amendments under black plastic mulch produced significantly different soil microbial community structure.},

  abstract = {Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are frequently suspected as significant point sources or conduits of microplastics to the environment. To directly investigate these suspicions, effluent discharges from seven tertiary plants and one secondary plant in Southern California were studied. The study also looked at influent loads, particle size/type, conveyance, and removal at these wastewater treatment facilities. Over 0.189 million liters of effluent at each of the seven tertiary plants were filtered using an assembled stack of sieves with mesh sizes between 400 and 45~μm. Additionally, the surface of 28.4 million liters of final effluent at three tertiary plants was skimmed using a 125~μm filtering assembly. The results suggest that tertiary effluent is not a significant source of microplastics and that these plastic pollutants are effectively removed during the skimming and settling treatment processes. However, at a downstream secondary plant, an average of one micro-particle in every 1.14 thousand liters of final effluent was counted. The majority of microplastics identified in this study had a profile (color, shape, and size) similar to the blue polyethylene particles present in toothpaste formulations. Existing treatment processes were determined to be very effective for removal of microplastic contaminants entering typical municipal WWTPs.},

Bioavailability and membrane disruption were proposed as the characteristics responsible for the observed fate and toxicity of both compounds. Diethyl phthalate was biodegraded rapidly in soil with a half-life (t50 deg) of 0.75 d at 20°C, and was not expected to persist in the environment. The DEHP, although biodegradable in aqueous solution (t50deg {$<$} 15 d at 20°C), was recalcitrant in soil, because of poor bioavailability (only 10\% degraded by 70 d at 20°C) and was predicted to account for the majority of phthalate contamination in the environment. Addition of DEP or DEHP to soil at a concentration similar to that detected in nonindustrial environments (0.1 mg/g) had no impact on the structural diversity (bacterial numbers, fatty acid methyl ester analysis) or functional diversity (BIOLOG) of the microbial community. At concentrations representative of a phthalate spill, DEP ({$>$}1 mg/g) reduced numbers of both total culturable bacteria (by 47\%) and pseudomonads (by 62\%) within 1 d. This was due to disruption of membrane fluidity by the lipophilic phthalate, a mechanism not previously attributed to phthalates. However, DEHP had no effect on the microbial community or membrane fluidity, even at 100 mg/g, and was predicted to have no impact on microbial communities in the environment.},

  abstract = {Container production has increased rapidly in many parts of the U.S. over the past 15 years. Container production has been the fastest growing sector in the nursery industry and the growth is expected to continue. Weed growth in container-grown nursery stock is a particularly serious problem, because the nutrients, air, and water available are limited to the volume of the container. The extent of damage caused by weeds is often underestimated and effective control is essential. Various researchers have found that as little as one weed in a small (1 gal) pot affects the growth of a crop. However, even if weeds did not reduce growth, a container plant with weeds is a less marketable product than a weed-free product. Managing weeds in a container nursery involves eliminating weeds and preventing their spread in the nursery, and this usually requires chemical controls. However, chemical controls should never be the only management tools implemented. Maximizing cultural and mechanical controls through proper sanitation and hand weeding are two important means to prevent the spread and regeneration of troublesome weeds. Cultural controls include mulching, irrigation methods (subirrigation), and mix type. Nursery growers estimate that they spend \$500 to \$4000/acre of containers for manual removal of weeds, depending on weed species being removed. Economic losses due to weed infestations have been estimated at approximately \$7000/acre. Reduction of this expense with improved weed control methodologies and understanding weed control would have a significant impact on the industry. Problems associated with herbicide use in container production include proper calibration, herbicide runoff concerns from plastic or gravel (especially when chemicals fall between containers) and the need for multiple applications. As with other crops, off-site movement of pesticides through herbicide leaching, runoff, spray drift, and non-uniformity of application are concerns facing nursery growers. This article reviews some current weed control methods, problems associated with these methods, and possible strategies that could be useful for container nursery growers.},

Concerns are recurrently raised that micro- and nanoplastics act as vector for organic contaminants to deeper soil layers and endanger groundwater resources. Whether and to what extent micro- and nanoplastics facilitate the transport of organic contaminants in soil remains unclear. Here we calculated the ratio between transport and desorption time scales using two diffusion models for micro- and nanoplastics between 100 nm and 1 mm. To identify micro- and nanoplastics bound contaminant transport we evaluated diffusion and partitioning coefficients of prominent agrochemicals and additives and of frequently used polymers e.g., polyethylene and tire material. Our findings suggest that the desorption of most organic contaminants is too fast for micro- and nanoplastics to act as transport facilitators in soil. Contaminant transport enabled by microplastics was found to be relevant only for very hydrophobic contaminants (logKow {$>$}5) under preferential flow conditions. While micro- and nanoplastics might be a source of potentially harmful contaminants in farmland soils this study suggests that they do not considerably enhance contaminant mobility.},

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) microfibers (PMFs) are among the main primary microplastics (as-produced polymer microparticles). Released in large amounts in laundry wastewaters, PMFs end up in freshwater and marine sediments due to their high density. PMFs are potentially hazardous pollutants for ecosystems and human health, being a deceiving food source for animal organisms at the base of the food chain (e.g. sediment and water filtrators, including edible shellfish and small crustaceans). This study describes a simple, sensitive and versatile procedure for quantifying the total mass of PET micro- and nano-particles in sediments. The procedure involves aqueous alkaline PET depolymerization with phase transfer catalysis, oxidation and fractionations to remove interfering species and pre-concentrate the terephthalic acid (TPA) monomer, and TPA quantification by reversed-phase HPLC. Recovery of TPA from a model sediment spiked with 800 ppm PET micropowder was 98.2 \%, with limits of detection/quantification LOD = 17.2 μg/kg and LOQ = 57.0 μg/kg. Analyses of sandy sediments from a marine beach in Tuscany, Italy, showed contamination in the 370–460 μg/kg range, suggesting that a not negligible fraction of PET microfibers released in surface waters ends up in shore sediments.},

  abstract = {Pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) permits to study the organic matter properties in bulk soil and requires few manipulations with respect to the traditional methodologies based on extraction and fractionation processes. In this paper, Py-GC has been proposed as a quick and valuable technique to study the structural evolution of organic matter in a mulched soil. A sandy clay loam soil (rendzina soil) was treated, under field conditions in the south-east of England, with organic (compost from dairy manure at the rates of 35 and 70 t ha−1, wheat straw at the rates of 2 and 4 t ha−1, plant residues representing the no-till treatment) and inert (black polyethylene) mulching materials. Nitrogen fertilization was considered as a traditional chemical treatment, while the control was an unmulched and no-fertilized soil. The objective of this research was to evaluate short-term (4 months) changes on chemico-structural properties of soil organic matter (SOM) and its trend towards mineralization and humification after mulching practices. Total and water-soluble C and N forms of the 0–10 cm layer were determined. Py-GC was used as a rapid and reproducible investigation technique (chemical probe) to characterize SOM. Pyrolytic humification and mineralization indices have been calculated. Compost increased the content of soil total and soluble C and N. On the other hand, straw mulched soil, due to straw being a poorly degradable material, showed both a relatively low N concentration of total and soluble forms and also the lowest concentration of water-soluble C (WSC). Pyrolytic data supported these results. Compost and straw treatments were characterized by low and high B/E3 indices, and high and low AL/AR ratios, respectively, suggesting the presence of more easily available organic components in compost mulched soils. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that compost treatments were principally related to soluble C and N and labile organic compounds, while straw and no-till showed stable SOM. Control, N fertilization and polyethylene treatments showed a similar SOM composition, which was characterized by pyrolytic fragments derived mostly from microbially linked nitrogenated compounds. The pyrolysis technique is a promising method in the assessment of changes in SOM composition, even in complex and dynamic mulching systems.},

A novel procedure for the selective quantitative and qualitative determination of organic solvent soluble microplastics and microplastics degradation products ({$<$}2 mm) in shoreline sediments was adopted to evaluate their concentration and distribution over the different sectors of a Tuscany (Italy) beach. Solvent extraction followed by gravimetric determination and chemical characterization by FT-IR, Pyrolysis-GC-MS, GPC and 1H NMR analyses showed the presence of up to 30 mg microplastics in 1 kg sand, a figure corresponding to about 5.5 g of generally undetected and largely underestimated microplastics in the upper 10 cm layer of a square meter of sandy beach ! The extracted microplastic material was essentially polystyrene and polyolefin byproducts from oxidative degradation and erosion of larger fragments, with accumulation mainly above the storm berm. Chain scission and oxidation processes cause significant variations in the physical and chemical features of microplastics, promoting their adsorption onto sand particles and thus their persistence in the sediments.},

In addition, the miniaturized ITMS is equipped with unique tandem MS capability. These features permit a better understanding of the complicated thermal behavior and the precise pyrolysates of materials. The pyrolysis of various standard reagent polymers such as polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, and polyphenylene sulfide has been examined by the TG-DTA-ITMS in inert atmosphere. The synergy effect of the skimmer-type interface and the ITMS was evaluated comparatively with conventional quadrupole mass spectrometry results. It was confirmed that the real-time monitoring ITMS/MS worked satisfactorily. Here, we demonstrate a valuable application of the TG-DTA-ITMS in the detailed analysis of commercial polymers.},

  abstract = {Density fractionation is frequently applied to separate soil organic matter according to the degree and the mode of interaction with minerals. Density fractions are operationally defined by density cut-off and sonication intensity, which determine the nature of the separated material. However, no tests or general agreements exist on the most appropriate density cut-off as well as on method and intensity of dispersion. Numerous variants have been proposed and applied, with results often contrasting each other and being hard to interpret. Here, we aimed at separating two light fractions (free and occluded into aggregates) composed of almost pure organic material, and one heavy fraction comprising the organic–mineral associations. We tested effects of different density cut-offs and sonication intensities, in combination and separately, on fraction yields, as well as on the fractions' organic carbon, total nitrogen and lignin-derived phenols. We tried to find optimum density cut-offs and sonication intensities, providing light fractions with maximum organic material and minimum contamination by mineral material. Under the test conditions, a density of 1.6gcm−3 gave best results for all test soils, allowing for separation of maximums amounts of almost pure organic material. The density cut-off at 1.6gcm−3 is well in line with previous studies and theoretical considerations, therefore we recommend the use of this density as most suitable for separation of organic debris. Sonication levels for aggregate disruption to achieve complete separation of occluded light organic matter varied amongst soils. The necessary intensity of dispersion relates to the type of soil, depending on the stability of contained aggregates. The application of one single dispersion energy level to different soils may result either in mineral contamination or in incomplete separation of light and heavy fractions as well as in redistribution of organic material amongst fractions. This means there is no single sonication level that can be applied to all soils. Thus, obtaining a meaningful light fraction residing within aggregates (occluded light fraction) requires assessment of the dispersion energy necessary to disrupt the aggregate system of a given soil without dispersion of organic–mineral associations. This can be done in pre-experiments where the soil is fractionated at different sonication levels. The appropriate dispersion is determined by mass yields and OC content of the obtained occluded fractions.},

  abstract = {Microplastic research is an emerging field. Consistent accurate identification of microplastic polymer composition is vital for understanding the effect of microplastic pollution in the environment. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is becoming commonplace for identifying microplastics. Conventional spectral identification is based on library searching, a process that utilizes a search algorithm against digital databases containing single spectra of pristine reference plastics. Several conditions on environmental microplastic particles such as weathering, additives, and residues cause spectral alterations relative to pristine reference library spectra. Thus, library searching is vulnerable to misidentification of microplastic samples. While a classification process (classifier) based on a collection of spectra can alleviate misidentification problems, optimization of each classifier (tuning parameter) is required. Additionally, erratic results relative to the particular optimized tuning parameter can occur when microplastic samples originate from new environmental or biological conditions than those defining the class. Presented in this study is a process that utilizes spectroscopic measurements in a hybrid fusion algorithm that depending on the user preference, simultaneously combines high-level fusion with low- and mid-level fusion based on an ensemble of non-optimized classifiers to assign microplastic samples into specific plastic categories (classes). The approach is demonstrated with 17 classifiers using FT-IR for binary classification of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastic samples from environmental sources. Other microplastic types are evaluated for non-class PET and HDPE membership. Results show that high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are obtained thereby reducing the risk of misidentifying microplastics.},

We found that earthworms have been predominantly used as the test species in investigating the effects of soil plastic pollution on organisms. Therefore, further research investigating the effects of plastic on other species models (invertebrates, plants, microorganisms, and insects) are required to understand the effects of plastic pollution on the overall soil ecosystem.

  abstract = {Mulching is one of the important agronomic practices in conserving the soil moisture and modifying the soil physical environment. Wheat, the second most important cereal crop in India, is sensitive to soil moisture stress. Field experiments were conducted during winter seasons of 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 in a sandy loam soil to evaluate the soil and plant water status in wheat under synthetic (transparent and black polyethylene) and organic (rice husk) mulches with limited irrigation and compared with adequate irrigation with no mulch (conventional practices by the farmers). Though all the mulch treatments improved the soil moisture status, rice husk was found to be superior in maintaining optimum soil moisture condition for crop use. The residual soil moisture was also minimum, indicating effective utilization of moisture by the crop under RH. The plant water status, as evaluated by relative water content and leaf water potential were favourable under RH. Specific leaf weight, root length density and dry biomass were also greater in this treatment. Optimum soil and canopy thermal environment of wheat with limited fluctuations were observed under RH, even during dry periods. This produced comparable yield with less water use, enhancing the water use efficiency. Therefore, it may be concluded that under limited irrigation condition, RH mulching will be beneficial for wheat as it is able to maintain better soil and plant water status, leading to higher grain yield and enhanced water use efficiency.},

Mulching is especially useful in the establishment of trees in landscapes that receive minimal care, such as restoration sites. In general, mulches improve soil health, creating healthy populations of plants and associated animals. These biodiverse, stable landscapes are more resistant to stress, are more aesthetically pleasing, require fewer applications of pesticides and fertilizers, and are ultimately more sustainable than those without mulch cover. All mulches are not created equally, however, and this review compares the costs and benefits of landscape mulches as reported in the scientific literature. It also presents real and perceived problems associated with various landscape mulches.},

The Southern Appalachian Mountains have a mosaic of land uses, including Christmas tree [Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir] farms, pastures, and unmanaged forests. We contrasted Christmas tree farm soil C pools with those of adjacent pastures and forests to estimate C storage differences due to land use. We partitioned soil C into fractions delineated by stability, an important determinant of long-term C sequestration potential. Soil C pools were quantified across a chronosequence of tree farms that varied in cultivation duration (3–51 yr) and interspace groundcover. We found that the duration of tree cultivation did not alter tree farm soil C pools; however, recalcitrant C pools were twice as high when interspace groundcover increased from 35 to 70\%. Total, active, slow, and recalcitrant soil C pools were highest in forests compared with pastures and tree farms. Tree farm soils had about 25\% lower C concentration than the adjacent forest soils, but because there was no downward trend with duration of cultivation, the reduction probably occurred rapidly following initial clearing. Tree farms and forests had longer mean residence times for active and slow C than pastures, potentially indicating an influence of woody root production. Our findings suggest that maintaining tree farm interspace vegetation, possibly through reduced herbicide use, can enhance soil C sequestration.},

Good agricultural practices (GAPs) are needed to reduce their human health risks, environmental impacts, and improve their cost-effectiveness. This study investigated the effect of fumigant application methods on soil persistence and emission of 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (CP). Field experiments were conducted to measure the individual and combined effects of pre-application tillage practices, fumigant application technology, and plastic films on 1,3-D soil concentrations to obtain a numerical index (CT value) to estimate their potential for pest control efficacy and to compare soil persistence, atmospheric flux rate, and cumulative emission of CP and 1,3-D under two diverse application scenarios. Greater 1,3-D soil vapor concentrations were observed by combining a pre-application soil seal with low soil disturbance application technology when compared to pre-application soil tillage and the use of back-swept application shanks. Under high density polyethylene plastic, the low disturbance scenario resulted in time weighted exposure concentration (CT) values ranging from 6.8 to 12.2~μg~h~cm−3 of soil as compared to CT values ranging from 2.9 to 5.4~μg~h~cm−3 under the conventional application scenario. Cumulative atmospheric emission of 1,3-D was decreased by 18\% under the low disturbance scenario and atmospheric emission of CP by 21\% when compared to a conventional application scenario. This study identified GAPs that can be readily implemented in the field to reduce the human and environmental impacts of soil fumigants and improve their cost-effectiveness under solid-tarp (broadcast) applications.},

Ranked in order of impact on the persistence of fumigants in soil were soil water content (moisture), soil tilth (the physical condition of soil as related to its fitness as a planting bed), the type of plastic film used to cover fumigated beds, and soil texture. Fumigants were readily detected 13 d after application when applied in uniformly compacted soils with water contents {$>$}200\% of capacity and covered by a virtually impermeable or metalized film. By contrast, 1,3-D and MITC had dissipated 5 d after application in soils with numerous large ({$>$}3 mm) clods and water contents below field capacity that were covered by low-density polyethylene. Soil degradation of CP, DMDS, and MITC were primarily attributed to biological mechanisms, whereas degradation of 1,3-D was attributed principally to abiotic factors.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that, for the solid-state product, the pores and mesh structure gradually increased along with the pyrolysis temperatures and time. Sintering and porous destruction were observed at a lower pyrolysis temperature (600 °C) with longer time (0.5 min). The pyrolysis vapors contained small gas molecules such as CO2 as well as complex organic compounds, mainly alcohols, esters, acids, aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, etc. In these products, aldehyde, ketone, and aromatic compounds were the main biochemicals; the appropriate pyrolysis temperature to produce aldehydes and ketones was 700 °C, and 600 °C was suitable for aromatic compounds. The regularity of the distribution of products and pyrolytic conditions was explored through eight representative compounds. The relationship between the product contents and pyrolysis conditions were complex for Helianthus annuus stems, but partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) methods were a powerful tool for screening biochemicals whose absolute contents were sensitive to the pyrolysis conditions.},

In this study, batch experiments were performed to study adsorption-desorption behavior and mechanism of triclosan (TCS) on MPs, polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS), and soil particles. PE showed the highest adsorption rate (29.3~mg~μg−1 h−1) and equilibrium capacity (1248~μg~g−1), while the similar profiles between PS (0.27~mg~μg−1 h−1 and 1033~μg~g−1, respectively) and soil (0.60~mg~μg−1 h−1 and 961~μg~g−1, respectively). Two adsorption stages, representing liquid-film and intra-particle diffusion were observed obviously for PE. Adsorption isotherm results revealed that the interaction between MPs and TCS was relatively weak. The sorption potential of soil was lower than that of MPs especially at high concentrations. PE addition induced TCS sorption increase in soil, while PS had no significant (P~{$>~$}0.05) influence. For MP-soil systems, TCS preferred to adsorb on MPs, which was more pronounced for PE than PS. The desorption rate of TCS was the highest for soil, followed by PE and PS, while equilibrium release amount ranked: PE~{$>~$}PS~{$>~$}soil. Moreover, soil solution better facilitated the desorption, with the amount increasing by 38\% for PE compared with 0.01~M CaCl2 solution. Therefore, MPs, especially PE with high adsorption and desorption potentials may serve as a source and carrier to TCS, and its amendment can change TCS environmental behavior and further risk in soil.},

The usage amount and residual rates of plastic film were the main factors explaining the variation among regions and leading to higher pollution load and contamination levels in agricultural big provinces. However, higher pollution loads and contamination levels frequently occurred under non-recycling than recycling scenarios during calculation. Extremely high loads (more than 10 kg/ha/year) of PAEs were estimated in five areas including Beijing city, Tibet, Liaoning Province, Jilin Province and Fujian Province and the high contamination levels in agricultural soil were presented in these places with more than 4.0 mg/kg under non-recycling scenarios. The predicted concentrations of PAEs in soils exceed the target value for soils from Netherlands (ΣPAEs = 0.1 mg/kg), indicating very high contamination of most Chinese agricultural soils. Significant differences in estimation results after plastic film utilization suggest that decreasing plastic film residue after application is an effective measure to control PAE pollution in soils. However, the comparison between contamination levels of PAEs estimated by the model and the previous detections of PAEs pollution levels in agricultural soils showed that there were presented wide range of PAE sources indicated to agricultural soils.},

In the current study, data for the major crops of China were collected from the national statistical archive on cultivation area, yield, application rates of fertilizer, pesticide, diesel, plastic film, irrigated water, etc. The CF of direct and indirect carbon emissions associated with or caused by these agricultural inputs was quantified with published emission factors. In general, paddy rice, wheat, maize and soybean of China had mean CFs of 2472, 794, 781 and 222 kg carbon equivalent (CE)/ha, and 0·37, 0·14, 0·12 and 0·10 kg CE/kg product, respectively. For dry crops (i.e. those grown without flooding the fields: wheat, maize and soybean), 0·78 of the total CFs was contributed by nitrogen (N) fertilizer use, including both direct soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and indirect emissions from N fertilizer manufacture. Meanwhile, direct methane (CH4) emissions contributed 0·69 on average to the total CFs of flooded paddy rice. Moreover, the difference in N fertilizer application rates explained 0·86–0·93 of the provincial variations of dry crop CFs while that in CH4 emissions could explain 0·85 of the provincial variation of paddy rice CFs. When a 30\% reduction in N fertilization was considered, a potential reduction in GHGs of 60 megatonne (Mt) carbon dioxide equivalent from production of these crops was projected. The current work highlights opportunities to gain GHG emission reduction in production of crops associated with good management practices in China.},

Although biodegradable plastics were considered as alternatives of traditional plastics, some evidence showed that biodegradable plastics might produce more microplastics. Until now, the effect of biodegradable microplastics on soil functions and processes, as well as microbial communities is uncertain. Based on high throughput sequencing, enzymatic activity assay and dynamic analysis of soil carbon and nitrogen, we investigated the effects of biodegradable polylactic acid microplastics (PLA MPs) on soil microbiota and related ecological processes under conditions of high or low carbon content. The results showed that PLA MPs had no significant effect on the overall diversity and composition of bacterial communities or related ecosystem functions and processes. However, co-occurrence network analysis revealed that PLA MPs impacted the interactions between constituent species, which might have legacy effect on soil bacterial communities and functions. Our data also revealed that PLA MPs could trade off the priming effect of carbon source. Our results provided an integrated picture in understanding the effects of PLA MPs on soil microbes, properties and ecological functions, which will help to further understand the effects of MPs on terrestrial ecosystems.},

The effects of different mulching practices (grass mulch, cornstalk mulch, film mulch, CK) on the soil bacterial community structure, and their implications for orchard productivity and fruit quality were studied in an apple orchard in the Loess Plateau. Treatments were established and sustained in the apple orchard since September 2006. The soil bacterial community structure, soil physicochemical properties, apple size and fruit quality were determined in 2011. A total of 383 clones from libraries were recovered and analyzed. The results demonstrated that the predominant groups in the bacterial community were Alphaproteobacteria (12.27\%), Betaproteobacteria (12.79\%), Acidobacteria (13.58\%) and Bacteroidetes (11.48\%). The ratios of the phyla Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria differed significantly (P \&lt; 0.05) among treatments. PCoA and Parsimony tests indicated that bacterial communities in mulching treatments were significantly different compared with the CK treatment. It was suggested that changes in the soil bacterial community structure and composition were associated with differences in organic material input and soil physicochemical conditions. Furthermore, stepwise regressions and principal component analyses indicated that changes in the soil bacterial community structure were associated with both orchard productivity and fruit quality in this region. Bacterial traits, i.e. ACE, were found in all of the regression models. Overall, the cornstalk mulch treatment resulted in better plant performance and soil fertilization than the other treatments. This study aimed to provide fundamental information for the scientific application of mulching practices and to serve as a theoretical foundation for maintaining the sustainability of agriculture in the ecosystems of the Loess Plateau.},

The protein sample was pyrolyzed instantaneously at high temperature (590 °C) in a stream of nitrogen gas. The Py-GC method developed in the present study does not require any pretreatment and the analysis time for determining sulfur in biological samples is as quick as 30 min. The sulfur detection limit of this method was 40 ng for methionine and 60 ng for cystine and cysteine. The coefficient of variation was 5.7, 11 and 14\% for methionine, cystine and cysteine, respectively. The determination of sulfur in biologically important substances such as human hair, dog hair, silk, etc. was carried out by the proposed Py-GC method. The analytical results revealed that sulfur is 3.3–4.3 wt.\% in human hair and 2.4–3.5 wt.\% in dog hair.},

To prepare appropriate countermeasures, it is essential to estimate the environmental damage cost of microplastics in the ocean in advance. Therefore, this study estimates willingness to pay of residents in Seoul metropolitan area in South Korea for removing the microplastics to provide the quantitative information of the environmental damage cost of microplastics in the ocean. This study employed one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice with spike model to collect the WTP responses data. To deal with the outliers, we assumed that the distribution of WTP is the contaminated normal distribution, which is heavy-tailed in comparison to normal distribution used in previous studies. In addition, to deal with the numerous zero WTP responses, this study employs the Bayesian censoring regression with data augmentation method. The estimate of the average yearly WTP is KRW 2845.6 (USD 2.59). Additionally, total WTP of households in Seoul metropolitan area was KRW 10.8 billion (USD 9.80 million) annually.},

For the Baltic Sea dimensions and under the considered idealised external conditions, (i) only one day is required for a foamed polystyrene particle to cross the sea (ca. 250km); (ii) polyethylene fibres should spend about 6–8months in the euphotic zone before sinking due to bio-fouling, whilst spherical particles can be retained on the surface up to 10–15years; (iii) for heavy microplastic particles, the time of settling through the water column in the central Gotland basin (ca. 250m) is less than 18h. Proper physical setting of the problem of microplastics transport and developing of physically-based parameterisations are seen as applications.},

Comparison of this methods’ efficiency to that of a widely used technique indicated that the new method has a considerably higher extraction efficiency. For fibres and granules an increase of 23\% and 39\% was noted, extraction efficiency of PVC increased by 100\%. The second method aimed at extracting microplastics from animal tissues based on chemical digestion. Extraction of microspheres yielded high efficiencies (94–98\%). For fibres, efficiencies were highly variable (0–98\%), depending on polymer type. The use of these two techniques will result in a more complete assessment of marine microplastic concentrations.},

However, the observed mass spectra are dependent on sampling conditions, in particular the DART gas temperature. This report describes the combination of a heated sample stage with DART-MS for polymer characterization. Methods Industrial polymers with different compositions were examined by thermal desorption and pyrolysis (TDPy) DART. Samples were heated on disposable copper stages from ambient temperature to 600°C, and the evolved gases were introduced directly into a DART ion source through a glass tee. Time- and temperature-dependent mass spectra were acquired using a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Kendrick mass analysis was applied to the interpretation of complex mass spectra observed for fluorinated polymers. Results Positive-ion DART mass spectra of common polymers exhibited peak series differing by monomer masses, often accompanied by a peak corresponding to the protonated monomer. Even polymers that did not exhibit a clear series of peaks produced characteristic mass spectra. Positive-ion and negative-ion mass spectra were recorded for fluorinated polymers, with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) producing only negative ions. Thermal desorption provided characteristic temperature profiles for volatile species such as polymer additives and polymer pyrolysis products. Conclusions In comparison with direct analysis by positioning sample directly in the heated DART gas stream, TDPy DART provides a more versatile sampling method and provides thermal separation and profiling of polymer additives, intact short polymer chains, and pyrolysis fragments.},

In some European countries, the reuse of biosolids as soil improver/fertilizer in arable crops represents the most used option. In order to control the quality of biosolids used for land application, every Member State has issued a national regulation based on the European directive.

In this study, 50 published aquatic surveys were reviewed and they demonstrated that most (\textasciitilde 80\%) only account for plastics ≥ 300 μm in diameter. In addition, we surveyed 770 personal care products to determine the occurrence, concentration and size distribution of polyethylene microbeads. Particle concentrations ranged from 1.9 to 71.9 mg g−1 of product or 1649 to 31,266 particles g−1 of product. The large majority ( {$>$} 95\%) of particles in products surveyed were less than the 300 μm minimum diameter, indicating that previous environmental surveys could be underestimating microplastic contamination.

  abstract = {Microplastics (plastic particles, 0.1 μm–5 mm in size) are widespread marine pollutants, accumulating in benthic sediments and shorelines the world over. To gain a clearer understanding of microplastic availability to marine life, and the risks they pose to the health of benthic communities, ecological processes and food security, it is important to obtain accurate measures of microplastic abundance in marine sediments. To date, methods for extracting microplastics from marine sediments have been disadvantaged by complexity, expense, low extraction efficiencies and incompatibility with very fine sediments. Here we present a new, portable method to separate microplastics from sediments of differing types, using the principle of density floatation. The Sediment-Microplastic Isolation (SMI) unit is a custom-built apparatus which consistently extracted microplastics from sediments in a single step, with a mean efficiency of 95.8\% (±SE 1.6\%; min 70\%, max 100\%). Zinc chloride, at a density of 1.5~g~cm−3, was deemed an effective and relatively inexpensive floatation media, allowing fine sediment to settle whilst simultaneously enabling floatation of dense polymers. The method was validated by artificially spiking sediment with low and high density microplastics, and its environmental relevance was further tested by extracting plastics present in natural sediment samples from sites ranging in sediment type; fine silt/clay (mean size 10.25~±~SD 3.02~μm) to coarse sand (mean size 149.3~±~SD 49.9~μm). The method presented here is cheap, reproducible and is easily portable, lending itself for use in the laboratory and in the field, eg. on board research vessels. By employing this method, accurate estimates of microplastic type, distribution and abundance in natural sediments can be achieved, with the potential to further our understanding of the availability of microplastics to benthic organisms.},

  abstract = {Mixtures of plastic particles of different types were analysed by Py-GC-MS in order to investigate the effect of polymer interactions on the composition of pyrolysates. Pyrolysis products associated to secondary reactions were observed when particles of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) were pyrolysed in the presence of poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) and the polyamides PA6 (polycaproamide) and PA66 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide)). Co-pyrolysis of PET in the presence of PVC particles produced mono and dichloroethyl esters of terephthalic acid due to the addition of HCl to the double bond of the vinyl group. Benzyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, 4-chlorobenzoic acid were also tentatively identified. The interaction between PET and PA6 and above all PA66 brought about the formation of aromatic nitriles including methyl and ethyl benzonitrile, 1,4-benzenedicarbonitrile, 4-cyanoethyl benzoate, 4-cyano benzoic acid. In addition, co-pyrolysis of PET and PA66 particles produced N-alkyl amides of benzoic acid. Pyrolysis of benzoic acid generated benzene and diphenyl, while N-hexylbenzamide was observed from the pyrolysis of benzoic acid with hexyl-1-amine or hexan-1,6-diamine. PE (polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PS (polystyrene) and PVC did not exhibit significant interactions. Calibration curves built up with single plastic types in the 10–120~µg range were used to quantify each polymer in the mixture using typical pyrolytic markers. The highest deviations of recovery and the lowest RSD were observed for PET and PA6, while polyolefins produced satisfactory recovery and RSD. The detection of pyrolysis products from secondary reactions can be used as markers for the co-presence of different polymers supporting their identification.},

Following deposition on beaches, plastic materials are exposed to UV radiation and physical processes controlled by wind, current, wave and tide action. Plastic particles from Kauai’s beaches were sampled to determine relationships between composition, surface textures, and plastics degradation. SEM images indicated that beach plastics feature both mechanically eroded and chemically weathered surface textures. Granular oxidation textures were concentrated along mechanically weakened fractures and along the margins of the more rounded plastic particles. Particles with oxidation textures also produced the most intense peaks in the lower wavenumber region of FTIR spectra. The textural results suggest that plastic debris is particularly conducive to both chemical and mechanical breakdown in beach environments, which cannot be said for plastics in other natural settings on Earth.},

  abstract = {Plastics are non-biodegradable, and increasing accumulation of plastic debris in the ocean is a major cause for concern. The World Economic Forum, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and McKinsey \& Company claimed in 2016 that technological innovations can solve the plastic problem. Such a claim raises an as yet unanswered question: how much technological innovation is needed and is it economically feasible? We offer answers to this question via a system dynamics model that we developed to simulate different scenarios aimed at controlling plastic debris entering the global ocean. Our results show that ocean cleanup technologies could achieve a 25\% reduction in the level of plastic debris in the ocean below 2010 levels in 2030. However, this would require removing 15\% of the stock of plastic debris from the ocean every year over the period 2020–2030, which equates to 135 million tons of plastic in total (metric tons). The implementation cost of such an ocean cleanup effort would amount to €492 billion-€708 billion, which represents 0.7\%–1.0\% of the world GDP in 2017 – this calculation is based on unit costs in €/kg estimated in The Ocean Cleanup project feasibility study. The Ocean Cleanup project alone is designed to collect 70,320 tons of plastic debris over a 10 year period. Removing 135 million tons of plastic debris would require investing in 1924 similar cleanup projects. These results help to assess the economic feasibility of removing such large volume of plastics. Moreover, our results provide quantitative confirmation that technological solutions alone are not sufficient to solve plastic pollution issues. A portfolio of diverse solutions – not only technological ones – is likely to have greater technical, political and economic feasibility. Our model shows that such a combined portfolio implemented over the period 2020–2030 could reduce the ocean plastic stock to 2013 levels (94 million tons) by 2030.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are emerging as a steadily increasing environmental threat. Wastewater treatment plants efficiently remove microplastics from sewage, trapping the particles in the sludge and preventing their entrance into aquatic environments. Treatment plants are essentially taking the microplastics out of the waste water and concentrating them in the sludge, however. It has become common practice to use this sludge on agricultural soils as a fertilizer. The aim of the current research was to evaluate the microplastic contamination of soils by this practice, assessing the implications of successive sludge applications by looking at the total count of microplastic particles in soil samples. Thirty-one agricultural fields with different sludge application records and similar edaphoclimatic conditions were evaluated. Field records of sludge application covered a ten year period. For all fields, historical disposal events used the same amount of sludge (40 ton ha−1 dry weight). Extraction of microplastics was done by flotation and particles were then counted and classified with the help of a microscope. Seven sludge samples were collected in the fields that underwent sludge applications during the study period. Soils where 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 applications of sludge had been performed had a median of 1.1, 1.6, 1.7, 2.3, and 3.5 particles g−1 dry soil, respectively. There were statistical differences in the microplastic contents related to the number of applications that a field had undergone (1, 2, 3 {$<$} 4, 5). Microplastic content in sludge ranged from 18 to 41 particles g−1, with a median of 34 particles g−1. The majority of the observed microplastics were fibers (90\% in sludge, and 97\% in soil). Our results indicate that microplastic counts increase over time where successive sludge applications are performed. Microplastics observed in soil samples stress the relevance of sludge as a driver of soil microplastic contamination.},

  abstract = {The growing evidence of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems reveals adverse effects of microplastics on soil biota and plant growth. However, since large scale assessments are lacking, it is possible that the laboratory based experiments conducted have assumed unrealistic microplastic concentrations in soils. In this paper we present regional scale data on the presence of microplastics in soils under different land uses in the central valley of Chile, which is characterized by urbanization, agricultural, and mining operations. We identified microplastics in soils under four different land use systems having different management intensities (crop lands, pastures, rangelands, and natural grasslands), and all somewhat prone to accumulate microplastics from different sources. We analyzed 240 soil samples from Chile's central valley, trying to identify the most probable sources of the microplastics. Our hypothesis was that microplastics were ubiquitous in the environment and that their concentration peaks follow the intensity of fertilizer use (phosphorus), soil heavy metals concentrations derived from nearby mining operations (Zn and Cu), and distance to roads and urban areas. We did find evidence of microplastic pollution in crop lands and pastures (306~±~360 and 184~±~266 particles kg−1, respectively), but we did not observe pollution of rangelands and natural grasslands. Distance to mining operations, roads, or urban areas did not increase the microplastic particles count. Our observations contradict the common belief that microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and relate the pollution problem more to agricultural activities. However, our data do not provide sufficient evidence to identify the pollution source. This is the first study that reports on microplastic occurrence in soils at a broad geographical scale. For greater insight on this topic more studies that contribute monitoring data about microplastics in soils are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Microplastic accumulation in soil may have a detrimental impact on soil biota. The lack of standardized methods to identify and quantify microplastics in soils is an obstacle to research. Existing techniques are time-consuming and field data are seldom collected. To tackle the problem, we explored the possibilities of using a portable spectroradiometer working in the near infrared range (350–2500 nm) to rapidly assess microplastic concentrations in soils without extraction. Four sets of artificially polluted soil samples were prepared. Three sets had only one polymer polluting the soil (low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC)). The fourth set contained random amounts of the three polymers (Mix). The concentrations of microplastics were regressed on the reflectance observed for each of the 2150 wavelengths registered by the instrument, using a Bayesian approach. For a measurement range between 1 and 100 g kg−1, results showed a root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) of 8, 18, and 10 g kg−1 for LDPE, PET, and PVC. The Mix treatment presented an RMSD of 8, 10, and 5 g kg−1 for LDPE, PET, and PVC. The repeatability of the proposed method was 0.2–8.4, 0.1–5.1, and 0.1–9.0 g kg−1 for LDPE, PET, and PVC, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that vis-NIR techniques are suitable to identify and quantify LDPE, PET, and PVC microplastics in soil samples, with a 10 g kg−1 accuracy and a detection limit ≈ 15 g kg−1. The method proposed is different than other approaches since it is faster because it avoids extraction steps and can directly quantify the amount of plastic in a sample. Nevertheless, it seems to be useful only for pollution hotspots.},

The evolved gases during degradation were inspected by a thermogravimetry analyser coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (TGA/FTIR) and also with a TGA coupled to a Mass Spectrometer (TGA/MS). Mass spectra showed that chemical species evolved in phenoxy decomposition in air were very similar to those assigned from degradation in nitrogen (water, methane, CO, CO(2), phenol, acetone, etc.). However, these species appear in different amount and at different temperatures in both atmospheres. FTIR analysis of the evolved products showed that water and methane were the beginning decomposition products, indicating that decomposition is initiated by dehydration and cleavage of C-CH(3) bond in the bisphenol-A unit of phenoxy resin. After this initial stage, random chain scission is the main degradation pathway.

Recent reports show that the increasing presence of microplastics in the environment could have significant deleterious consequences over the health of marine organisms, but also across the food chain. Herein, we have studied the effects of artificial seawater on polyethylene (PE)-based beads by exposing them up to eight weeks to saltwater in stirred batch reactors in the dark and examined the structural and morphological changes these endured. Electron microscopy observations showed that artificial seawater induces severe microcracking of the pellets' surfaces. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses evidenced the formation of oxidized groups whenever these particles were exposed to water and an increase in organic matter content of the waters in which the pellets were kept was evidenced by Raman spectroscopy. There were also noticeable consequences in the thermal stability of the polyethylene pellets, as determined by thermogravimetric studies (TGA). Furthermore, the parallel exposure of polyethylene pellets to UV radiation yielded less pronounced effects, thus underscoring its lower preponderance in the degradation of this material. These results highlight the importance of determining the mechanisms of degradation of microplastics in marine settings and what the implications may be for the environment. Overall, the herein presented results show that a relatively short period of time of accelerated exposure can yield quantifiable chemical and physical impacts on the structural and morphological characteristics of PE pellets.},

  abstract = {Aflatoxins are potent mycotoxins that cause developmental and immune system suppression, cancer, and death. As a result of regulations intended to reduce human exposure, crop contamination with aflatoxins causes significant economic loss for producers, marketers, and processors of diverse susceptible crops. Aflatoxin contamination occurs when specific fungi in the genus Aspergillus infect crops. Many industries frequently affected by aflatoxin contamination know from experience and anecdote that fluctuations in climate impact the extent of contamination. Climate influences contamination, in part, by direct effects on the causative fungi. As climate shifts, so do the complex communities of aflatoxin-producing fungi. This includes changes in the quantity of aflatoxin-producers in the environment and alterations to fungal community structure. Fluctuations in climate also influence predisposition of hosts to contamination by altering crop development and by affecting insects that create wounds on which aflatoxin-producers proliferate. Aflatoxin contamination is prevalent both in warm humid climates and in irrigated hot deserts. In temperate regions, contamination may be severe during drought. The contamination process is frequently broken down into two phases with the first phase occurring on the developing crop and the second phase affecting the crop after maturation. Rain and temperature influence the phases differently with dry, hot conditions favoring the first and warm, wet conditions favoring the second. Contamination varies with climate both temporally and spatially. Geostatistics and multiple regression analyses have shed light on influences of weather on contamination. Geostatistical analyses have been used to identify recurrent contamination patterns and to match these with environmental variables. In the process environmental conditions with the greatest impact on contamination are identified. Likewise, multiple regression analyses allow ranking of environmental variables based on relative influence on contamination. Understanding the impact of climate may allow development of improved management procedures, better allocation of monitoring efforts, and adjustment of agronomic practices in anticipation of global climate change.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are considered to be a widespread environmental contaminant. Due to their small size microplastics have the potential to be ingested by a range of aquatic organisms which mistake them for a food source and can suffer adverse impacts as a result. Development of standardised methods is imperative to provide reliable and meaningful data when analysing microplastic ingestion by marine fauna. A range of proteolytic digestive enzymes (trypsin, papain and collagenase) were tested to establish optimum digestion efficacy of biological samples and assess the effects of enzymes on microplastics; additionally the applicability of freezing and formaldehyde followed by ethanol as specimen preservation techniques for microplastic research was investigated. Of the enzymes investigated, trypsin yielded the greatest digestive efficacy based on weight reduction (88\% ± 2.52 S.D.) at the lowest concentration (0.3125\%) with no observed impacts on microplastics. Enumeration of microplastics from wild collected Mytilus edulis revealed mean numbers of 1.05 ± 0.66 S.D. (minimum) to 4.44 ± 3.03 S.D. (maximum) microplastic particles per g wet weight mussel tissue depending on location. There was no significant difference based on preservation method on the quantification of ingested microplastics and no detrimental impacts were observed on the microplastics directly. Enzymatic digestion using trypsin therefore provides a suitable, time and cost effective method to extract microplastics from M. edulis. Furthermore the preservation methods did not have detrimental effects on microplastics, serving to highlight the suitability of biological samples preserved either way for future inquiries into ingested microplastics.},

  abstract = {The Niagara wine region of Ontario is at the northern fringe of adaptability for Vitis vinifera. In some growing seasons many V. vinifera cultivars do not reach full maturity before the impending winter forces harvest. It has been demonstrated in many studies that sunlight is critical to quality grape production through its effect on photosynthesis and on the expression of genes involved in production of secondary metabolites important to grape quality. Reflective mulch has the potential to improve berry quality through its effect on the microclimate within the canopy and in particular light penetration into the fruiting zone. A multi-varietal trial was established in a commercial vineyard in 2003 to determine the effect of reflective mulch on berry, must and wine quality of Ontario grown V. vinifera grapes. It was hypothesised that increased light resulting from the reflective mulch would improve berry quality, which would in turn produce deeply colored wines with pleasantly, complex sensory characteristics. Results reported in this paper are limited to the cultivar ‘Cabernet Franc’ portion of this study, which includes an assessment of microclimate within the canopy, berry quality over development from cluster closure to harvest and an experiment to determine the effect of reflective mulch on insect populations within the canopy. The reflective mulch product used in this study deteriorated significantly over the season becoming oxidized, dirty and in some cases losing it reflective coating. While this deterioration undoubtedly impacted the results of this study, mulch enhanced the quantity and quality of light into the fruiting zone, advanced veraison and in general increased °Brix, total phenolics, flavonols and anthocyanins of ‘Cabernet Franc’ berries at harvest. Mulch also reduced the number of insects trapped in the canopy especially aphids and leafhoppers. These results indicate there is potential for reflective mulch to improve berry quality in Niagara grown grapes, particularly in a late, cool or short growing season.},

  abstract = {Microplastic research is a rapidly developing field, with urgent needs for high throughput and automated analysis techniques. We conducted a review covering image analysis from optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and spectral analysis from Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis gas–chromatography mass–spectrometry, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. These techniques were commonly used to collect, process, and interpret data from microplastic samples. This review outlined and critiques current approaches for analysis steps in image processing (color, thresholding, particle quantification), spectral processing (background and baseline subtraction, smoothing and noise reduction, data transformation), image classification (reference libraries, morphology, color, and fluorescence intensity), and spectral classification (reference libraries, matching procedures, and best practices for developing in-house reference tools). We highlighted opportunities to advance microplastic data analysis and interpretation by (i) quantifying colors, shapes, sizes, and surface topologies with image analysis software, (ii) identifying threshold values of particle characteristics in images that distinguish plastic particles from other particles, (iii) advancing spectral processing and classification routines, (iv) creating and sharing robust spectral libraries, (v) conducting double blind and negative controls, (vi) sharing raw data and analysis code, and (vii) leveraging readily available data to develop machine learning classification models. We identified analytical needs that we could fill and developed supplementary information for a reference library of plastic images and spectra, a tutorial for basic image analysis, and a code to download images from peer reviewed literature. Our major findings were that research on microplastics was progressing toward the use of multiple analytical methods and increasingly incorporating chemical classification. We suggest that new and repurposed methods need to be developed for high throughput screening using a diversity of approaches and highlight machine learning as one potential avenue toward this capability.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution research has suffered from inadequate data and tools for spectral (Raman and infrared) classification. Spectral matching tools often are not accurate for microplastics identification and are cost-prohibitive. Lack of accuracy stems from the diversity of microplastic pollutants, which are not represented in spectral libraries. Here, we propose a viable software solution: Open Specy. Open Specy is on the web (www.openspecy.org) and in an R package. Open Specy is free and allows users to view, process, identify, and share their spectra to a community library. Users can upload and process their spectra using smoothing (Savitzky–Golay filter) and polynomial baseline correction techniques (IModPolyFit). The processed spectrum can be downloaded to be used in other applications or identified using an onboard reference library and correlation-based matching criteria. Open Specy’s data sharing and session log features ensure reproducible results. Open Specy houses a growing library of reference spectra, which increasingly represents the diversity of microplastics as a contaminant suite. We compared the functionality and accuracy of Open Specy for microplastic identification to commonly used spectral analysis software. We found that Open Specy was the only open source software and the only software with a community library, and Open Specy had comparable accuracy to popular software (OMNIC Picta and KnowItAll). Future developments will enhance spectral identification accuracy as the reference library and functionality grows through community-contributed spectra and community-developed code. Open Specy can also be used for applications beyond microplastic analysis. Open Specy’s source code is open source (CC-BY-4.0, attribution only) (https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/OpenSpecy).},

  abstract = {Microplastics have been detected in aquatic sediments around the world, highlighting the propensity of this matrix to serve as a sink for these structural pollutants. More reliable and reproducible extraction protocols for microplastics would facilitate comparisons across studies. A number of different extraction techniques are currently used to separate microplastics from sediment and almost exclusively employ density-based separations, which take advantage of the inherent densities of plastic particles. Some of these techniques are cost-effective but fail to fully recover all plastic types. Other techniques may recover most plastic types, but are more costly and/or hazardous to human or environmental health. We present here a novel, cost-effective oil extraction protocol (OEP) that provides an alternative to density-based approaches by taking advantage of the oleophilic properties of microplastics. Using this technique, we counted microplastic particles in spiked sediment samples using light microscopy and observed 96.1\% ± 7.4 recovery for total microplastics, with recovery rates of 92.7\% ± 4.3 for fibers and 99\% ± 1.4 for particles. Subsequent analysis with Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) revealed that the oil interfered with the FTIR spectrum of microplastics, but that an additional, post-extraction clean-up step using ethyl alcohol (90\%) removed residual traces of oil and eliminated the FTIR spectral interference. The application of this new technique to shoreline sediment samples collected from sites in urban Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and a remote beach on Vancouver Island, as well as bulk seawater, demonstrated that the oil extraction protocol is effective for environmental samples. This novel OEP represents a cost-effective and reliable alternative to leading density-based techniques.},

Rhodic eutrudox soils with forest vegetation, from unburnt and burnt cane plantations and that of a sandy phase having cerrado vegetation were investigated. From the organic soil fraction humic acids were extracted that decompose similarly to the commercial product, following the steps: i) adsorbed water, dehydrations, decarboxylations and release of organic molecules, ii) thermolabile decomposition fraction, iii) macromolecular organic matter and iv) residues. The DSC curves gave the corresponding peak for water release near 100 degrees C and exothermic peaks at temperatures higher than 300 degrees C, attributed to the combustion of thermolabile organic matter. The TG curves for all soil samples are more complex than those of the humic acids due to the inorganic components, being characterized by stages i) dehydration process, ii) thermolabile organic matter, iii) macromolecular organic domain and iv) oxide residues. These steps of decomposition correspond to three endothermic DSC peaks and one exothermic peak clearly shown under a synthetic air atmosphere, being attributed to the combustion of the macromolecular organic fraction near 300 degrees C. The DSC curves from burnt and unburnt red Latosol soils from sugar cane cultivation showed more intense endothermic peaks than those of the forest. These thermal results show the influence of both the type and the organic matter contents on curve profiles, which are highly influenced by the soil mineral compositions and land-use activities, as well as the burning processes.},

Soils of a control site with no history of biosolid application were also examined. High MP concentrations of between 8.7~×~103 MP kg−1 and 1.4~×~104 MP kg−1 were found in biosolids samples. Lower MP concentrations observed in Provider 2 biosolids may be due to storage, settling and supernatant removal prior to applications. Annual MP additions to agricultural soils across Ontario were estimated at between 4.1~×~1011 and 1.3~×~1012 particles. All fields receiving biosolids had higher soil pre-treatment MP concentrations than the control. The field with the greatest number of previous biosolid treatments had the highest pre-treatment soil MP concentrations; suggesting some MP retention in soils between applications. Immediately following biosolids applications, two fields demonstrated significant increases in soil MP concentrations, with preferential retention of MP fibers over fragments observed, while a reduction in soil MP concentrations were observed in the third. Surprisingly, only one field demonstrated a net gain in soil MPs over the course of the study. At all three fields, {$>$}99\% of MPs applied in biosolids in 2017 were unaccounted for. The study suggests that despite adhering to applicable legislation, biosolids applications at all sites likely result in high rates of MP export. This study is the first to track MP transport through soils following their application in biosolids, and contributes to filling current knowledge gaps regarding export of MPs to aquatic systems from the terrestrial environment.},

The framework details how to incorporate secondary MP formation into the plastic's life cycle as related to the plastic's use phase, and location specific waste treatment and how to connect the impacts with current life cycle impact assessment methodologies (LCIA). Plastics, now ubiquitous in the environment are a potential source of emerging pollution and have been shown to have negative effects of various species. Thus, the framework consist of 1) a degradation module, which accounts for micro- and nano- plastic formation with dynamic degradation of microparticles, 2) an emissions module accounts for the potential of the plastic particles to be emitted to air, and 3) an impacts module which connects the various emissions to existing LCIA methods. The framework allows for quantification of secondary microplastic in an LCA context and for further characterization of the impacts at endpoints in terms of human health, and allows for a high level of regionalization, both in terms of input data and characterization of impact damages. SecµPlast was tested on a case study of mulch film which showed that the per kg contribution to particulate matter (PM) and other impacts is low. The impacts vary largely depending on the degradation rate and ranged from 9.24×10−6 to 0.00043 kg PM equivalents per kg of mulch film, depending on either a slow or fast degradation rate, respectively. The impact came mostly from the littered fraction, which was estimated to be 10\% of the products weight after the use phase, in Europe. The degradation rates due to UV degradation were low, 0.034 µg/year for a slow degradation rate, compared to values derived from the literature, 0.345 µg/year for a fast degradation rate during littering, that included other sources of degradation, such as abrasion. However, when these impacts are scaled up to the European consumption of plastics and monetized, it is evident that even small increases of PM are costly for society and could potentially amount to millions of dollars per year in human health damages. Further research efforts should focus on filling data gaps, such as microplastic losses during production, recycling and potentially incineration, as well as degradation kinetics including other degradation factors such as freeze/thawing, wet/drying in combination with UV degradation.},

Plant growth and yields were inconsistent with mulch colors during the three seasons. In Fall 1988, in a once-over harvest, extra-large (≥ 70 mm diameter) and marketable fruit yields were higher (P ≤ 0.05) on blue than on the conventional white mulch. In Spring 1989, early marketable yields on red mulch were higher than on black mulch, and in Fall 1989, under high stress from tomato mottle virus (TMoV) transmitted by silverleaf whitefly [Bemisia argentifolii (Bellows and Perring)], seasonal yield of extra-large fruit was better on orange than white mulch. In Fall 1988 and 1989, fruit size and marketable yields were reduced on yellow mulch. Aphids (Aphididae), thrips (Thripidae), and whiteflies were counted monthly in traps placed on the mulched beds. Aphids were least numerous on the aluminum and yellow and most numerous on the blue mulch. Where differences occurred, the fewest thrips were captured on aluminum and the fewest whiteflies were captured on the yellow, aluminum and orange mulches. Although differences were not always significant, the fewest adult whiteflies also were observed on foliage of tomato plants grown on these latter three mulches. Later in the seasons, as plant foliage covered the mulch, differences in the number of insects captured were similar for all mulch colors. Low numbers of whiteflies on the orange and aluminum mulches early in Fall 1989 delayed virus symptom development and increased yields. Virus symptom development was not delayed and yields were low on the yellow mulch, in spite of the low number of whiteflies. When averaged over all mulch colors, extra-large and marketable fruit yields increased linearly with delayed symptom development. It is proposed that, under high insect stress, mulches should be selected for their effects on insects in addition to their effects on soil temperature and plant morphology.},

  abstract = {Plastic film mulching (PFM) is an agricultural management practice that is commonly used to suppress weed growth. However, its effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has not been well evaluated. To investigate the effect of PFM on GHG emissions and crop productivities, black PFM and no-mulching plots were installed as the main treatment, and three sub-treatments, chemical fertilizer (NPK) and two green manures, were arranged within each main treatment. Two cover crops (hairy vetch and barley) with different carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios were cultivated in the two green manure treatments during the fallow season. The aboveground biomasses of vetch (23–25 Mg fresh weight ha−1) and barley (10–11 Mg ha−1) were incorporated before maize seedling transplanting. Maize was cultivated without chemical fertilization in the two green manure treatments, whereas the recommended chemical fertilizers were applied in the NPK treatment. During two annual cropping seasons, the emission rates of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases were simultaneously monitored once a week using the closed-chamber method. Total global warming potential (GWP) was calculated as CO2 equivalents by multiplying the seasonal CH4 and N2O fluxes by 25 and 298, respectively. Irrespective of soil amendments, PFM significantly increased soil temperature and moisture content by a mean of 2 °C and 0.04 m3 m−3 over no-mulching, respectively. Plastic film mulching increased grain productivity by 8–33\% over no-mulching. However, PFM significantly decreased soil organic matter content and largely increased the two major GHG emissions. As a result, PFM increased the total GWP by 12–82\% over no-mulching, irrespective of the soil amendments. In conclusion, more sustainable mulching systems should be developed that can sustain soil quality and minimize environmental impacts, including GHG emissions.},

Despite the alarming and well-documented accumulation of plastics in the marine environment, little attention has been paid to the sources, fate and effects of microplastics in terrestrial settings. We overview the prevalence of microplastics in soils, evaluate their impacts, and appraise the current difficulties in their determinations in terms of sampling, isolation and identification. Abstract There has been an increasing interest by both the general public and the scientific community in microplastic-related pollution. Owing to their physical and chemical characteristics, these highly ubiquitous contaminants may be ingested by numerous organisms at the base of food-webs. Furthermore, owing to their tendency to adsorb other chemical substances, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), these plastic particles can lead to bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena, which significantly increases their potential environmental effects. However, most of the current research available is focussed on the prevalence and effects of these materials in water, and, more precisely, in oceans. Although this is understandable, owing to the alarming accumulation of plastics in this environmental compartment, little attention has been paid to the sources, fate and effects of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial settings. This is further complicated by the current lack of universally accepted methods for the assessment and identification of MPs, not only in liquid, but also in solid matrices. We overview the most current data regarding the presence and prevalence of MPs in soils and evaluate their recognised impacts and potential consequences. We also appraise the current sampling, isolation and identification methodologies and suggest methods that may contribute to the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the sampling and characterisation of these pervasive pollutants in complex matrices, such as soils.},

  abstract = {There has been a considerable increase on research of the ecological consequences of microplastics released into the environment, but only a handful of works have focused on the nano-sized particles of polymer-based materials. Though their presence has been difficult to adequately ascertain, due to the inherent technical difficulties for isolating and quantifying them, there is an overall consensus that these are not only present in the environment - either directly released or as the result of weathering of larger fragments - but that they also pose a significant threat to the environment and human health, as well. The reduced size of these particulates ({$<$}1 mu m) makes them susceptible of ingestion by organisms that are at the base of the food-chain. Moreover, the characteristic high surface area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles may add to their potential hazardous effects, as other contaminants, such as persistent organic pollutants, could be adsorbed and undergo bioaccumulation and bioamplification phenomena. In this review, we describe the most relevant sources of nanoplastics and offer some insights into their fate once released into the environment. Furthermore, we overview the most prominent effects of these small particulates, while identifying the key challenges scientists currently face in the research of nanoplastics in the environment. Lastly, we give a brief summary of the economic impacts of the pollution caused by plastic litter - a potential key source of nanoplastics - in the oceans, the most common destination of these contaminants.

In the first experiment, samples were incubated in the laboratory at 4, 10, 16, 23 or 30°C, with constant moisture, and the loss of 14C was monitored for 550 days. Double negative exponential functions fitted to the 14C loss data at different temperatures were used to define the relative proportions of labile and recalcitrant components in the original straw. The estimated proportions of these constituents were related to incubation temperatures with the amount of C reflecting the labile fraction increasing with increasing temperature. In the second experiment samples mixed with the labelled straw were incubated at 4, 16 or 30°C until the same percentage of 14C loss was reached. The samples were then incubated again at a common temperature for 30 days and CO2 production was measured to assess the lability of the remaining material. For all the soils, the amount of readily decomposed material was higher in samples conditioned at 4° than at 30°C. It was concluded that in addition to temperature controlling rates of C mineralisation in soil it also affects the processes of decomposition so that material produced at higher temperatures was more recalcitrant than at lower temperatures.},

In this study, we evaluated the potential of a soil universal model method (SUMM) based on thermogravimetry (TGA) for the identification and quantification of microplastics in standard loamy sand. Blank and spiked soils (with amounts of one of four microplastic types) were analyzed by TGA. For each sample, thermal mass losses (TML) in 10 °C intervals were extracted and used for further analysis. To explain and demonstrate the principles of SUMM, two scenarios were discussed. The first refers to a rare situation in which an uncontaminated blank of investigated soil is available and TML of spiked and blank soils are subtracted. The results showed that the investigated microplastics degraded in characteristic temperature areas and differences between spiked and blank soils were proportional to the microplastics concentrations. The second scenario reflects the more common situation where the blank is not available and needs to be replaced by the previously developed interrelationships representing soil universal models. The models were consequently subtracted from measured TML. Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) identified 8 of 14 modeled differences between measured TMLs and the universal model as meaningful for microplastics discrimination. Calibrating various microplastics concentrations with the first principal component extracted from sPCA resulted in linear fits and limits of detection in between environmentally relevant microplastics concentrations. Even if such an approach using calculated standards still has limitations, the SUMM shows a certain potential for a fast pre-screening method for analysis of microplastics in soils.},

The formation of cross-links is nevertheless detected by GPC in all cases except with iron carboxylate. Fragmentation of the films is observed at high doses in all cases. When xenon radiation is used, cross-linking is much more important, as indicated by the broadening of the MWD and the lowering of the OD at 1715 cm−1. The difference between photodegradation by solar light and by xenon irradiation was assigned to a temperature effect and interpreted using the classical spontaneous mechanism of polyethylene degradation.},

Quantitative assessment of microplastics in soil has been limited so far. Until now, microplastic analyses in soil require laborious sample cleanup and are mostly restricted to qualitative assessments. In this study, we applied thermogravimetry–mass spectrometry (TGA–MS) to develop a method for the direct quantitative analysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) without further sample pretreatment. For this, soil samples containing 1.61 ± 0.15 wt \% organic matter were spiked with 0.23–4.59 wt \% PET bottle recyclate microplastics. dl-Cysteine was used as the internal standard (IS). Sample mixtures were pyrolyzed with a 5 K min–1 ramp (40–1000 °C), while sample mass loss and MS signal intensity of typical PET pyrolysis products were recorded. We found MS signal intensities linearly responding to microplastic concentrations. The most-promising results were obtained with the IS-corrected PET pyrolysis product vinylbenzene/benzoic acid (m/z = 105, adj. R2 = 0.987). The limits of detection and quantification were 0.07 and 1.72 wt \% PET, respectively. Our results suggest that TGA–MS can be an easy and viable complement to existing methods such as pyrolysis or thermogravimetry–thermal desorption assays followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry detection or to spectral microscopy techniques.},

Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.},

The black surface reflected less total light and less blue light, but a higher ratio of far-red (FR) relative to red (R) light. In a controlled environment, tomato plants that were exposed to brief periods of FR at the end of the daily photosynthetic period were taller than those that received brief periods of R. The effect of FR on plant height could be reversed by R and implies phytochrome involvement. Differences in the light spectrum reflected from the plastic, and the similar differential responses to mulch color and light treatments, suggest that tomato plants grown in plastic mulch culture may respond to relatively small changes in light environment induced by the surface color of the mulch.},

  abstract = {A new and more alarming source of marine contamination has been recently identified in micro and nanosized plastic fragments. Microplastics are difficult to see with the naked eye and to biodegrade in marine environment, representing a problem since they can be ingested by plankton or other marine organisms, potentially entering the food web. An important source of microplastics appears to be through sewage contaminated by synthetic fibres from washing clothes. Since this phenomenon still lacks of a comprehensive analysis, the objective of this contribution was to investigate the role of washing processes of synthetic textiles on microplastic release. In particular, an analytical protocol was set up, based on the filtration of the washing water of synthetic fabrics and on the analysis of the filters by scanning electron microscopy. The quantification of the microfibre shedding from three different synthetic fabric types, woven polyester, knitted polyester, and woven polypropylene, during washing trials simulating domestic conditions, was achieved and statistically analysed. The highest release of microplastics was recorded for the wash of woven polyester and this phenomenon was correlated to the fabric characteristics. Moreover, the extent of microfibre release from woven polyester fabrics due to different detergents, washing parameters and industrial washes was evaluated. The number of microfibres released from a typical 5~kg wash load of polyester fabrics was estimated to be over 6,000,000 depending on the type of detergent used. The usage of a softener during washes reduces the number of microfibres released of more than 35\%. The amount and size of the released microfibres confirm that they could not be totally retained by wastewater treatments plants, and potentially affect the aquatic environment.},

We investigated the presence, characteristics, and potential health risks of microplastic dust ingestion. The plastic load of 88 to 605 microplastics per 30 g dry dust with a dominance of black and yellow granule microplastics ranging in size from 250 to 500 μm was determined in 10 street dust samples using a binocular microscope. Fluorescence microscopy was found to be ineffective for detecting and counting plastic debris. Scanning electron microscopy, however, was useful for accurate detection of microplastic particles of different sizes, colors, and shapes (e.g., fiber, spherule, hexagonal, irregular polyhedron). Trace amounts of Al, Na, Ca, Mg, and Si, detected using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, revealed additives of plastic polymers or adsorbed debris on microplastic surfaces. As a first step to estimate the adverse health effects of microplastics in street dust, the frequency of microplastic ingestion per day/year via ingestion of street dust was calculated. Considering exposure during outdoor activities and workspaces with high abundant microplastics as acute exposure, a mean of 3223 and 1063 microplastic particles per year is ingested by children and adults, respectively. Consequently, street dust is a potentially important source of microplastic contamination in the urban environment and control measures are required.},

A comparison of successful classification models was made in order to evaluate prediction performance for 13 classes of polymers. A rigorous methodology was applied using a pipeline scheme to avoid bias in the training and selection phases. The application of an oversampling technique also contributed by compensating unbalanceness in the dataset. The log-loss was used as the minimization function target and to assess performance.

While studies on the environmental monitoring and characterization of microplastics demonstrated the urgent need for a drastic reduction in plastic waste generation, the effectiveness of the various regulatory and policy interventions implemented or proposed in Africa countries remains poorly understood. We critically examined policies, legislations, and regulations enacted to control microplastic pollution in Africa to develop a sustainable, harmonized framework for the coordinated reduction of plastic waste generation across Africa. Analysis of the interventions revealed most African countries employed traditional perspective (i.e., command-and-control) approaches, whereby state instruments such as plastic ban, production and importation levies, and consumer taxes were enacted. However, the continued increase in microplastic waste generation suggests traditional perspective approaches might not be effective in Africa. Although rarely used in Africa, market-oriented approaches such as private-public waste management are often effective in controlling plastic pollution. Hence, we proposed a bottom-up hybrid regulatory approach for managing microplastics pollution in Africa, involving price-based, right-base, legislation and behavioral frameworks based on best practices in microplastic waste management.},

Plastisols (pastes) were prepared by mixing PVC, plasticizer, and thermal stabilizer. The plasticized PVC (p-PVC) films are obtained by gelation at 160 degrees C for 15 min. The p-PVC films were heat treated at 50, 85, 100, 130, and 160 degrees C up to 420 min to follow the mass loss to find out diffusivity of plasticizer out of films into air and to determine related activation energies. The films having di-octyl terephthalate (DOTP) and di-isononyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (DINCH) exhibited the lowest mass loss in general, among the phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizer having p-PVC films, respectively, as confirmed by FTIR investigation. The same tendency was observed for diffusion coefficients and for the activation energies of migration. The diffusion coefficients were found to be around 3.5 x 10182.1 x 1017 m2/sec for the studied plasticizers in PVC at 50 degrees C and around 4.0 x 10159.9 x 1014 m2/sec at 160 degrees C. The activation energies for 85160 degrees C interval were determined to be between 70 and 153 kJ/mol (0.721.58 eV) for the plasticizers used herein those could be treated as a homologous series as deduced from the related compensation factors.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with finite element calculations are used to explore the conformational dynamics of a thermo-sensitive oligomer, namely poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), subjected to an ultra-fast heating–cooling cycle. Finite element (FE) calculations were used to predict the temperature profile resulting from laser-induced heating of the polymer–aqueous system. The heating rate (∼0.6 K ps−1) deduced from FE calculations was used to heat an aqueous solution of PNIPAM consisting of 30 monomeric units (30-mer) from 285 K to 315 K. Non-equilibrium effects arising from the ultra-fast heating–cooling cycle results in a hysteresis during the coil-to-globule transition. The corresponding atomic scale conformations were characterized by monitoring the changes in the vibrational spectra, which provided a reliable metric to study the coil-to-globule transition in PNIPAM and vice-versa across the LCST. The vibrational spectra of bonds involving atoms from the oligomer backbone and the various side-groups (amide I, amide II, and the isopropyl group of PNIPAM) of the oligomers were analyzed to study the conformational changes in the oligomer corresponding to the observed hysteresis. The differences in the vibrational spectra calculated at various temperatures during heating and cooling cycles were used to understand the coil-to-globule and globule-to-coil transitions in the PNIPAM oligomer and identify the changes in the relative interactions between various atoms in the backbone and in the side groups of the oligomer with water. The shifts in the computed vibrational spectral peaks and the changes in the intensity of peaks for the different regions of PNIPAM, seen across the LCST during the heating cycle, are in good agreement with previous experimental studies. The changes in the radius of gyration (Rg) and vibrational spectra for amide I and amide II regions of PNIPAM suggest a clear coil-to-globule transition at ∼301 K during the heating cycle from 285 K to 315 K. During the heating cycle, a comparison of the vibrational spectra of isopropyl groups in PNIPAM at 285 K and 315 K suggests dehydration of the isopropyl moieties at 315 K. This implies that the oligomer–water interactions are dominant below the LCST whereas oligomer–oligomer interactions pre-dominate above the LCST. On the other hand, during the cooling cycle minor changes in the Rg and vibrational spectra of the PNIPAM oligomer in going from 315 K to 285 K indicate that the interactions between oligomer–oligomer and between the oligomer and water are less perturbed during the cooling cycle. Our simulations suggest that the observed hysteresis is a consequence of ultrafast heating–cooling kinetics, which allows insufficient relaxation times for the solvated oligomer.},

Microplastic contamination of soils is being increasingly documented, with potential consequences for soil biodiversity and function. Notwithstanding, data on effects of such contaminants on fundamental properties potentially impacting soil biota are lacking. The present study explores the potential of microplastics to disturb vital relationships between soil and water, as well as its consequences for soil structure and microbial function. During a 5-weeks garden experiment we exposed a loamy sand soil to environmentally relevant nominal concentrations (up to 2\%) of four common microplastic types (polyacrylic fibers, polyamide beads, polyester fibers, and polyethylene fragments). Then, we measured bulk density, water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, soil aggregation, and microbial activity. Microplastics affected the bulk density, water holding capacity, and the functional relationship between the microbial activity and water stable aggregates. The effects are underestimated if idiosyncrasies of particle type and concentrations are neglected, suggesting that purely qualitative environmental microplastic data might be of limited value for the assessment of effects in soil. If extended to other soils and plastic types, the processes unravelled here suggest that microplastics are relevant long-term anthropogenic stressors and drivers of global change in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Their potential impacts in terrestrial ecosystems remain largely unexplored despite numerous reported effects on marine organisms. Most plastics arriving in the oceans were produced, used, and often disposed on land. Hence, it is within terrestrial systems that microplastics might first interact with biota eliciting ecologically relevant impacts. This article introduces the pervasive microplastic contamination as a potential agent of global change in terrestrial systems, highlights the physical and chemical nature of the respective observed effects, and discusses the broad toxicity of nanoplastics derived from plastic breakdown. Making relevant links to the fate of microplastics in aquatic continental systems, we here present new insights into the mechanisms of impacts on terrestrial geochemistry, the biophysical environment, and ecotoxicology. Broad changes in continental environments are possible even in particle-rich habitats such as soils. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that microplastics interact with terrestrial organisms that mediate essential ecosystem services and functions, such as soil dwelling invertebrates, terrestrial fungi, and plant-pollinators. Therefore, research is needed to clarify the terrestrial fate and effects of microplastics. We suggest that due to the widespread presence, environmental persistence, and various interactions with continental biota, microplastic pollution might represent an emerging global change threat to terrestrial ecosystems.},

However, little is known about the cascade of events in fundamental levels of terrestrial ecosystems, i.e., starting with the changes in soil abiotic properties and propagating across the various components of soil–plant interactions, including soil microbial communities and plant traits. We investigated here the effects of six different microplastics (polyester fibers, polyamide beads, and four fragment types: polyethylene, polyester terephthalate, polypropylene, and polystyrene) on a broad suite of proxies for soil health and performance of spring onion (Allium fistulosum). Significant changes were observed in plant biomass, tissue elemental composition, root traits, and soil microbial activities. These plant and soil responses to microplastic exposure were used to propose a causal model for the mechanism of the effects. Impacts were dependent on particle type, i.e., microplastics with a shape similar to other natural soil particles elicited smaller differences from control. Changes in soil structure and water dynamics may explain the observed results in which polyester fibers and polyamide beads triggered the most pronounced impacts on plant traits and function. The findings reported here imply that the pervasive microplastic contamination in soil may have consequences for plant performance and thus for agroecosystems and terrestrial biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Particles play important roles in terrestrial systems, where the natural soil environment provides a complex habitat in which the three-dimensional organization of mineral and organic matter is combined to a diverse array of water levels, microscopic life forms, and their metabolites. Soils are the foundation for most land-based life and terrestrial ecosystem services that benefit humans. When plastics arrive at the soil, their nonnatural structure, distinct chemical composition, and unique surface properties trigger a series of abrupt environmental changes in the soil. Indeed, the current evidence suggests changes in the fundamental physical, chemical, and microbiological properties of the soils. Consequently, water and other biogeochemical cycles, as well as plant performance and animal health, can be affected. In this chapter, we present the recent advances in understanding how microplastics can change elementary properties of soil systems, such as soil aggregation and structure. This is discussed jointly with the linked effects in the microbial activity and function. Then, we address the recent studies regarding the effects of micro- and nanoplastics on plants and animals. Finally, we elaborate the properties of the various types of microplastics, soil processes, and soil organisms that are probably influencing the observed effects. We conclude by highlighting that current scientific information is not enough to devise solid risk assessments on microplastics in soils and suggest research directions to fulfill this gap.},

  abstract = {Common agricultural practices such as excessive use of agro-chemicals, deep tillage and luxury irrigation have degraded soils, polluted water resources and contaminated the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about interrelated environmental problems such as soil degradation, desertification, erosion, and accelerated greenhouse effects and climate change. The decline in organic matter content of many soils is becoming a major process of soil degradation, particularly in European semi-arid Mediterranean regions. Degraded soils are not fertile and thus cannot maintain sustainable production. At the same time, the production of urban and industrial organic waste materials is widespread. Therefore, strategies for recycling such organic waste in agriculture must be developed. Here, we review long-term experiments (3–60 years) on the effects of organic amendments used both for organic matter replenishment and to avoid the application of high levels of chemical fertilizers. The major points of our analysis are: (1) many effects, e.g. carbon sequestration in the soil and possible build-up of toxic elements, evolve slowly, so it is necessary to refer to long-term trials. (2) Repeated application of exogenous organic matter to cropland led to an improvement in soil biological functions. For instance, microbial biomass carbon increased by up to 100\% using high-rate compost treatments, and enzymatic activity increased by 30\% with sludge addition. (3) Long-lasting application of organic amendments increased organic carbon by up to 90\% versus unfertilized soil, and up to 100\% versus chemical fertilizer treatments. (4) Regular addition of organic residues, particularly the composted ones, increased soil physical fertility, mainly by improving aggregate stability and decreasing soil bulk density. (5) The best agronomic performance of compost is often obtained with the highest rates and frequency of applications. Furthermore, applying these strategies, there were additional beneficial effects such as the slow release of nitrogen fertilizer. (6) Crop yield increased by up to 250\% by long-term applications of high rates of municipal solid waste compost. Stabilized organic amendments do not reduce the crop yield quality, but improve it. (7) Organic amendments play a positive role in climate change mitigation by soil carbon sequestration, the size of which is dependent on their type, the rates and the frequency of application. (8) There is no tangible evidence demonstrating negative impacts of heavy metals applied to soil, particularly when high-quality compost was used for long periods. (9) Repeated application of composted materials enhances soil organic nitrogen content by up to 90\%, storing it for mineralization in future cropping seasons, often without inducing nitrate leaching to groundwater.},

Production can be improved by reducing evapotranspiration and loss of infiltrated water by the use of a plastic cover. We monitored soil moisture fortnightly over 1~yr using a neutron probe near four trees in an olive grove (Olea europaea, var. Arbequina), two of which had a plastic cover buried in the topsoil around them. These trees were monitored using three neutron probe access tubes per tree to compare the behaviour of soil moisture over time with two other identically instrumented and nearby trees with no cover. Analysis was based on the resultant moisture profiles. The plastic cover retained moisture and increased soil water residence time. During the dry season, the amount of water retained in the plots was at most 15–20\% greater in the mid-season and at least 5–6\% greater at the end of season than in the central part of the plots near the trunk. The plastic cover was effective to ca. 50~cm with maximum water content near the soil surface. During the wet season, the cover did not affect soil water. Soil moisture was greater near the tree trunk as a result of stemflow and throughfall.},

  abstract = {Plastic mulches are widely used for the production of vegetables. There are numerous studies on the use of plastic mulches for peppers, although relatively few have focused on the microenvironmental and physiological impacts of plastic mulches on bell pepper. The objectives were to determine the effects of plastic film mulches on root zone temperature (RZT), soil water status, incidence of thrips and Tomato spotted wilt (TSW), plant growth, gas exchange, accumulation of mineral nutrients, and fruit yield in bell pepper. The study was conducted in Tifton, GA, in the Fall of 2002 and the Spring of 2003 using eight colored plastic mulches. Plastic mulch color influenced the microenvironmental, physiological, and yield responses of bell pepper plants. Plastic film mulches differed in their soil-warming ability with RZTs in both spring and fall being highest in black mulches and lowest in silver mulches. The percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reflected from the mulches was highest in silver mulches and lowest in black mulches. The mean RZT under the plastic mulch decreased with increasing percentages of reflected PAR. The number of thrips per flower and the incidence of TSW in mature plants were not significantly different among plastic mulch treatments. The number of thrips per flower had no relationship with the percentage of reflected PAR or with RZT. Plastic mulch treatments had no significant effect on soil water status. Neither soil water content nor soil water potential had a relationship with RZT. In the fall season, during the first 28 days after transplanting, plant growth attributes were among the highest in silver mulches and the lowest in black mulches. Gas exchange and accumulation of mineral nutrients in the leaves and the fruit were not significantly affected by plastic mulches. Both marketable and total yields were higher on silver mulches and lowest on black mulch in the fall, whereas they were in general higher on silver with a black strip mulch and lowest on white and silver1 mulches in the spring. The reduced plant growth and fruit yields in black mulches during the fall were probably the result of the increased RZTs, and thus higher heat accumulation, that resulted in higher plant heat stress conditions compared with silver and white mulches. Fruit yield decreased with mean seasonal RZTs above 27.5 °C. The optimal range of RZT for bell pepper fruit yield was computed to be 25 to 27.5 °C or less.},

  abstract = {Soil warming is one of the benefits associated with use of plastic film mulches. However, under high temperature conditions during the summer, especially in the southeastern United States, some mulches warm the soil to temperatures that might be deleterious to plant growth. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants grown in the field were exposed to a range of root-zone temperatures (RZTs), resulting from growing the plants in different seasons and by using colored mulches that differed in their soil-warming ability. The objective was to determine the relationship of mean seasonal RZT, as affected by different colored plastic film mulches, with plant growth and fruit yield. The study consisted of experiments carried out in three seasons: Fall 1999 (five mulches, one cultivar), Spring 2000 (eight mulches and three cultivars), and Fall 2000 (four mulches and three cultivars). Treatments were black (n = 2), gray, red, silver (n = 3), and white (n = 2) mulches, and bare soil. Over the season, mean RZT decreased in the fall (from 32 to 24 °C) and increased in the spring (from 20 to 29 °C). Daily mean values of RZT over the season under plastic mulches were higher (1 to 5 °C) than those of air temperature. The highest RZT at midday occurred under black mulch, and the lowest under bare soil and white mulch. Bare soil showed the largest diurnal RZT fluctuation. RZT at midday was up to 4 °C higher under black or gray mulch compared to the other mulches or bare soil. The degree of soil warming was correlated with reflectivity of the mulch. Black mulch had the lowest light reflectance [10\% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)] while silver mulch had the highest (55\% PAR). There were, however, differences in reflectance among mulches of the same color depending on the manufacturer. RZT affected vegetative top fresh weight (FW), fruit yield, fruit number, and individual fruit FW. All these growth attributes fitted a quadratic relationship with mean RZT for the season, with an optimal that ranged between 25.4 and 26.3 °C. The effects of colored mulches on plant response depended on the impact of the mulch on RZT. Plant growth and yield were highest as RZT approached the optimal RZT for the plants.},

  abstract = {Tomatillo (Physalis ixocarpa Brot. ex Hornem) is a popular crop in Mexico and other Latin American countries. There is an increasing demand for this vegetable in the United States, particularly from the growing Latino population. However, there is limited information about tomatillo production. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of plastic mulches on plant growth, yield, and root zone temperature in two cultivars of tomatillo. The study was conducted in Spring and Summer 2000. The design was a randomized complete block with a split plot arrangement, where plastic film mulch (black, gray, and silver mulches, and bare soil) was the main plot and cultivar (`Toma Verde' and `Verde Puebla]) the subplot. In the spring, mulch treatments had little effect on plant growth during the first 30 days after transplanting and there were no significant differences in fruit yields. In the summer planting, both early growth and fruit yields were greatest with the silver and gray mulch treatments and lowest on bare soil. Plant growth during the establishment was related with subsequent plant growth and yield. In mature plants, vegetative top fresh weight and total fruit yield were higher (P {$<$} 0.01) in the spring than in the summer. Total fruit yield (both seasons), marketable yield (spring) and cull yield (spring) were lower in `Toma Verde' than in `Verde Puebla'. Root zone temperatures (RZTs) in the spring (mean = 26.4 °C) were lower than in the summer (mean = 29.3 °C). In both seasons, mean RZT was highest under black mulch and lowest in bare soil. In the summer, plant growth and fruit yields tended to decrease with increasing RZTs. Tomatillo plants grown on mulches with a mean seasonal RZT of 30 °C had fruit yields that were 65\% (`Toma Verde') or 50\% (`Verde Puebla') lower respectively than those of plants on mulches with a RZT of 27 °C. There were no significant differences in foliar concentrations of N, Ca, Mg, S, B, Zn, Cu and Na among mulches. Foliar concentrations of the majority of mineral nutrients were not related with the mean RZT for the season.},

  abstract = {Plastic film mulches are often associated with increases in plant growth and yield of vegetable crops. Few studies, however, report on the effect of plastic film mulches on root zone temperature on broccoli. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of colored plastic mulches on root zone temperature and broccoli plant growth and yield Broccoli (‘Packman’) plants were grown using plastic film mulch and drip irrigation. The treatments consisted of plastic film mulch (black, blue, gray on black, red, silver on black, and white on black mulches) and bare soil. Colored plastic film mulches affected root zone temperature and the accumulation of soil degree-days. Mean daily RZT, maximal daily RZT and degree day accumulation in the soil were highest in dark-colored mulches (blue, black, red, and gray) and lowest in light-colored mulches (silver and white), while minimal daily RZT was highest in silver mulch and lowest in white mulch. Silver mulch showed the smallest diurnal fluctuations in RZT among plastic mulches, with the highest RZT during the night and among the lowest in the afternoon. Colored plastic mulches also affected broccoli plant growth and yield, although the effect of mulches was more dramatic in the spring than in the fall seasons. Broccoli yield was linearly related to both the vegetative top dry weight and root dry weight of mature plants. Broccoli yield was little affected at mean RZT of \&lt;21 °C but increased with increasing mean RZTs above 21 °C up to 25 °C. Thus, broccoli plant growth and yield responded more favorably to dark-colored mulches than to light-colored mulches, suggesting that broccoli benefited from increased soil warming. No high RZT stress effects on broccoli plant growth or yield were observed in this study. Thus, this study suggests that plastic film mulches, particularly the dark-colored mulches, may be an option for spring broccoli production in areas with cool conditions early in the spring.},

  abstract = {Processes controlling the dynamics of the soil–water interfacial properties have a high impact on habitat, filter, buffer, storage, and transformation functions of a soil. Besides surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity, also the dynamics of surfaces properties in soils limit the application of well established methods of wettability determination for solid materials. Numerous studies investigated the influence of changing environmental conditions, like water content, pH and drying and wetting temperature on the repellency of soils. The present paper presents an integral approach linking some of the individual results of several studies. Two hypothetical models are suggested in order to explain differences in the nature of repellency between two types of sites and between wettable and repellent samples within each type of site. The chemical nature dominating the soil water repellency at the one type of sites can be best explained by hydrolysis–condensation reactions. The physico-chemical nature dominating the repellency on the other type of site is probably controlled by micelles- or reverse-micelles-like arrangement of amphiphilic molecules during drying. Wetting properties of the surface layers of organic coating on the soil particles then depend on number and size of amphiphilic molecules, pH and ionic strength in the soil solution. It is concluded that local site properties, e.g., soil-type, climate, or land-use, determine which mechanism controls the dynamics of repellency. Future research has to verify the suggested mechanisms before critical environmental conditions can be identified in order to prevent the negative impacts of soil water repellency.},

To enable low quantification limits, an analytical method has been developed combining pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and pyrolysis GC-MS. The automated extraction includes a pre-extraction step via methanol followed by a subsequent PLE using tetrahydrofuran. For the most frequently used synthetic polymers polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), limits of quantification were achieved down to 0.007 mg/g. Recoveries above 80\% were attained for solid matrices such as soil and sediments. The developed method was applied for MP quantification in environmental samples such as sediment, suspended matter, soil, and sewage sludge. In all these matrices, PE and PP were detected with concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 3.3 mg/g. In sewage sludge samples, all three polymers were present with concentration levels ranging between 0.08 ± 0.02 mg/g (PP) and 3.3 ± 0.3 mg/g (PE). However, especially for solid samples, the analysis of triplicates revealed elevated statistical uncertainties due to the inhomogeneous distribution of MP particles. Thus, care has to be taken when milling and homogenizing the samples due to the formation of agglomerates. Open image in new window Graphical abstract},

When runoff was applied to marine mesocosms containing grass shrimp and mummichog fish, unsettled runoff produced the greatest mortality, although even settled runoff caused more mortality than that in the control mesocosm receiving runoff without added copper.

  abstract = {Biodegradable plastics have been developed to eliminate the progressive accumulation and ever-growing threat posed by conventional fossil fuel-derived plastics. The impact of these bioplastics, particularly in an agricultural context (e.g. biopolymer mulch films), however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared the biotoxicity of biodegradable (polylactic acid, PLA; polypropylene carbonate, PPC) and non-degradable (polyethylene, PE) microplastics using a series of standardized bioassays using the earthworm Eisenia fetida. The responses studied included: avoidance behavior, mortality, biomass, and reproduction responses. We incubated earthworms in artificial soils amended with different concentrations of microplastic (0, 0.125, 1.25, 12.5, 125, 250, and 500 g kg−1) under laboratory conditions. This wide range allowed linear regression modeling and estimation of microplastic effect thresholds. Our results showed that microplastic concentration rather than plastic type was more important in regulating earthworm responses to soil contamination. The critical threshold for microplastic contamination was 40 g kg−1, after which earthworms exhibit microplastic avoidance behavior. A significant reduction (EC10) in number of cocoons and juvenile earthworms occurred at a concentration of 53 g kg−1 and 97 g kg−1, respectively; while no significant effect was found for survival of earthworm until levels of 500 g kg−1. Overall, the two biodegradable materials (PLA and PPC), appeared to be no more biofriendly than PE. Based on reported levels of plastic contamination in soil of up to 67 g kg−1, we conclude that microplastics are now starting to pose a threat to earthworm population. To better evaluate the risk posed by biodegradable and nondegradable plastics, further mechanistic studies on how microplastics affect earthworm behavior and the potential long-term impacts of this on soil functioning are required.},

As a new type of environmental pollutant, MPs have increasingly attracted the attention of scientists and have led to marked increases in both public and political awareness. However, their distribution and fates in the terrestrial environment are limited. We investigated the distribution and characteristics of MPs in the agricultural soils of Shaanxi Province, a typical agricultural province in China. We found evidence that 100\% of agricultural soils contained MPs. The concentration of MPs in the soil ranged from 1430 to 3410 items/kg. Fibers and small-sized particles (0–0.49~mm) were the predominant type and size, respectively. Polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles were identified in agricultural soil. Furthermore, the abundance of microplastics in agricultural soil is closely related to the planting type of soil and climatic factors. The results from this study confirmed the presence of a high abundance of MPs in agricultural soil, and proved that agricultural activities might have caused MP contamination in soil.},

Most studies assessing microplastics focused on marine environments, while terrestrial and soil systems have been overlooked. In this review, we analyzed the current knowledge regarding microplastic pollution in natural soil or agricultural ecosystems. We focused on reviewing the procedural steps for microplastic extraction and identification in detail. The heterogeneity of the methods applied, lack of standardized procedures and incompatible parameters reported, make the results incomparable among most studies. Several microplastic concentration units are needed to make studies comparable. Correctly determining and reporting microplastic morphotypes are key to understanding the sources of contamination. Minimal considerations and recommendations were stated for extraction, digestion, filtration, and polymer identification procedures. Baseline contamination prevention measures were identified as mandatory along the entire sampling, handling and identification procedures. Lastly, knowledge gaps were identified and discussed for further research.},

The efficiency of this technique is closely related with a number of factors such as soil water and organic matter contents and feature of cover material; therefore, the effect of solarization was studied under applications of CO2, basaltic tuff (BT), organic matter (OM) and a different color plastic cover (PE2) on soil temperature and microbial activity as dehydrogenase enzyme activity (DHA) and soil respiration (CO2). The trial was carried out in a greenhouse for 32 days. Organic matter, salt and lime contents, pH and texture class of greenhouse soil were 1.7\%, 0.055\%, 38.5\%, 7.7 and clay, respectively. According to the results, while the lowest CO2 value was determined as 12.9 mg/100 g ds. 24 h in the A6 (PE2) application, the highest CO2 value was determined as 16.3 mg/100 g ds. 24 h in the A4 (+OM 1.5 kg/m(2)) application. The dehydrogenase enzyme activities (DHA) yielded similar results with the applications, however, the highest value (291.2 mu g TPF/10 g ds.) was in A7 (control). Soil (0-5 cm) temperatures varied between 28.1 and 60.1 degrees C with applications and the lowest soil temperature was determined in the control plot. The effect of the applications to soil temperature led to significant differences statistically (p{$<$}0.05). The results documented that the organic matter (OM) and CO2 amendments (OM or +OM+CO2) had a role in protecting soil microbial activity (dehydrogenase-DHA) and soil respiration (CO2) from the detrimental effects of the heating of solarization.},

Soil surface covering decreases erosion, reduces evaporation, protects against raindrop impact, and increases aggregate stability. The following field experiment was carried out at the experimental farm in Mydlniki in Krakow, Poland in 2008/09 and 2009/10. Winter leek and onion covered by biodegradable nonwoven (Bionnole 100 g.m(-2) and IBWCH 75 g.m(-2)) film were assessed to estimate the changes in several physical and chemical soil properties. The experiment revealed the interaction between treatments and wet-aggregate content in soil. The biofilm covering slightly increased the amount of large aggregates (4.0-2.5 mm) and decreased the percentage of small sized macroaggregates (0.50-0.25 mm). We also observed a trend in the increase of water capacity in soils following treatments. The obtained results suggest that the use of biodegradable film as covering could be an alternative to the traditional plastic films widely used in the world.},

This study was conducted during 2003 and 2004 to determine if furrow-bed seeding and plastic mulching improve stand establishment and cotton lint yield in a saline field. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with seeding patterns (flat-seeded and furrow-seeded) as main plots and mulching (with or without plastic mulching) as subplots. The effects of seeding patterns, mulching, and their interactions on root-zone salinity, soil temperature, stand establishment, and lint yield were monitored. Furrow seeding reduced the root-zone salinity, while plastic mulching both reduced salinity and increased soil temperatures. As a result, furrow-seeded cotton under plastic mulching increased stand establishment and lint yield by 103 and 25\% in 2003, and 92 and 22\% in 2004, compared with flat-seeded cotton without mulching, respectively. Plastic mulching and furrow seeding also enhanced earliness as indicated by the percentage of the first two harvests. Physiological assay 30 d after seeding (DAS) showed that plastic mulching and furrow seeding substantially reduced Na+ accumulation both in root and leaf tissues, inhibited peroxidation of lipids, and improved leaf photosynthesis (Pn) and dry matter production. The overall results suggest that use of plastic mulching plus furrow-bed seeding would be a suitable cultural practice for enhancing cotton production in saline soils.},

The mass percentages of NP recovered from the effluent (Meff) with a salinity of 35 practical salinity units (PSU) were ranked as follows: NPC (19.69\%) {$>$} NPS (16.37\%) {$>$} NPA+ (13.33\%) {$>$} NPA− (9.78\%). The homoaggregation of NPS and NPA− was observed in seawater. The transport of NPA− exhibited a ripening phenomenon (i.e., a decrease in the transport rate with time) due to the high attraction of NP with previously deposited NP, whereas monodispersed NPA+ presented a low Meff value because of the electrostatic attraction between NPA+ and negatively charged sand. Retention experiments showed that the majority of NPC, NPS and NPA+ accumulated in a monolayer on the sand surface, whereas NPA− accumulated in multiple layers. Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) could remarkably improve the transportability of NPC, NPS, and NPA− by increasing steric repulsion. The strong attraction between NPA+ and the deposited NPA+ in the presence of SRHA triggered the weak ripening phenomenon. As seawater salinity decreased from 35 PSU to 3.5 PSU, the increase in electrostatic repulsion of NP-NP and NP-sand enhanced the transport of NPC, NPS, and NPA−, and the ripening of NPA− breakthrough curves disappeared. In deionized water, NPC, NPS, and NPA− achieved complete column breakthrough because the electrostatic repulsion between NP and sand intensified. However, the Meff values of NPA+ in 3.5 PSU seawater and deionized water presented limited increments of 15.49\% and 23.67\%, respectively. These results indicated that the fate of NP in sandy marine environments were strongly affected by NP surface functionalities, seawater salinity, and coexisting SRHA.},

This chapter discusses approaches to defining and assessing soil quality and suggests one possible form for a soil quality index. It is essential that basic soil quality indicators relate to ecosystem functions such as C and N cycling and are components of driving variables for process- oriented models that emulate the ways ecosystems function. Evaluating the diverse effects of climate and management on soil function requires integration of basic physical, chemical, and biological indicators. The ability to assess soil quality and identify key soil properties is complicated by the many issues defining quality and the multiplicity of physical, chemical, and biological factors that control biogeochemical processes and their variation in time, space, and intensity.},

Anthropogenic reductions in soil health, and of individual components of soil quality, are a pressing ecological concern. A conference entitled ‘Soil Health: Managing the Biological Component of Soil Quality’ was held was held in the USA in November 1998 to help increase awareness of the importance and utility of soil organisms as indicators of soil quality and determinants of soil health. To evaluate sustainability of agricultural practices, assessment of soil health using various indicators of soil quality is needed. Soil organism and biotic parameters (e.g. abundance, diversity, food web structure, or community stability) meet most of the five criteria for useful indicators of soil quality. Soil organisms respond sensitively to land management practices and climate. They are well correlated with beneficial soil and ecosystem functions including water storage, decomposition and nutrient cycling, detoxification of toxicants, and suppression of noxious and pathogenic organisms. Soil organisms also illustrate the chain of cause and effect that links land management decisions to ultimate productivity and health of plants and animals. Indicators must be comprehensible and useful to land managers, who are the ultimate stewards of soil quality and soil health. Visible organisms such as earthworms, insects, and molds have historically met this criterion. Finally, indicators must be easy and inexpensive to measure, but the need for knowledge of taxonomy complicates the measurement of soil organisms. Several farmer-participatory programs for managing soil quality and health have incorporated abiotic and simple biotic indicators. The challenge for the future is to develop sustainable management systems which are the vanguard of soil health; soil quality indicators are merely a means towards this end.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of the 2010s, the number of investigations on microplastics in freshwater increased dramatically. However, almost no study aims at investigating the various sources and fate of microplastics in a catchment. This chapter aims at analyzing the various sources and fate of microplastics for an urban catchment and its hydrosystem (sewage, runoff, etc.). It presents the results obtained during a 3-year study of the Paris Megacity. Such a study required the development of appropriate sampling strategies for each compartment. It was highlighted that fibers are highly concentrated in the studied area, and therefore a focus in this category of microplastics was carried out. The atmospheric fallout exhibited important levels of fibers. However, at the scale of the Parisian agglomeration, wastewater treatment plant disposals and combined sewer overflows represent the major sources (number of fibers introduced per year) among the studied ones.},

  abstract = {Sources, pathways and reservoirs of microplastics, plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, remain poorly documented in an urban context. While some studies pointed out wastewater treatment plants as a potential pathway of microplastics, none have focused on the atmospheric compartment. In this work, the atmospheric fallout of microplastics was investigated in two different urban and sub-urban sites. Microplastics were collected continuously with a stainless steel funnel. Samples were then filtered and observed with a stereomicroscope. Fibers accounted for almost all the microplastics collected. An atmospheric fallout between 2 and 355 particles/m(2)/day was highlighted. Registered fluxes were systematically higher at the urban than at the sub-urban site. Chemical characterization allowed to estimate at 29\% the proportion of these fibers being all synthetic (made with petrochemicals), or a mixture of natural and synthetic material. Extrapolation using weight and volume estimates of the collected fibers, allowed a rough estimation showing that between 3 and 10 tons of fibers are deposited by atmospheric fallout at the scale of the Parisian agglomeration every year (2500 km(2)). These results could serve the scientific community working on the different sources of microplastic in both continental and marine environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results showed that our three-stage method with repeatedly addition of hydrogen peroxide had the highest efficiency in removing mangrove vegetal litter when compared with the three classical digestion methods. The high match scores of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy proved that the developed method had little impacts on the integrity of five polymer types of microplastics.

MPs were widely detected in different areas of the wetland even in the protection area with little human activities. Direct human activities resulted in more severe MPs contamination in the protection area than the tourism area. In the soil of different areas, the MPs abundances ranged from 136 to 2060 items/kg. The concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ranged from 536 to 660 μg/kg, and the concentrations of polycarbonate (PC) ranged from 83.9 to 196 μg/kg. The MP abundances of the three areas had significant correlations with PET concentrations. These results indicate that the direct influence of human activities has much greater contribution than indirect influence. These results also suggest that PET concentration can be used as a potential marker of MPs contamination in wetland soils.},

In this paper a new method is described to adsorb the decomposition products during controlled conditions in TGA on solid-phase extraction (SPE) material: twisters. Subsequently the twisters were analysed with thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TDS-GC-MS), which allows the decomposition products to be separated and identified using an MS library. The thermoplastics polyamide 66 (PA 66) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) were used as example polymers. The influence of the sample mass and of the purge gas flow during the decomposition process was investigated in TGA.

A sample is first decomposed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and the gaseous decomposition products are then trapped on a solid-phase adsorber. Subsequently, the solid-phase adsorber is analyzed with thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TDU-GC–MS). This method is ideally suited for the analysis of polymers and their degradation processes. Here, a new entirely automated system is introduced which enables high sample throughput and reproducible automated fractioned collection of decomposition products. The fractionated collection together with low temperatures reduces the risk of contamination, improves instrumental stability and minimizes maintenance efforts. Through variation of the two main parameters (purge gas flow and heating rate) it is shown how the extraction process can be optimized. By measuring the decomposition products of polyethylene it is demonstrated that compounds with masses of up to 434\,Da can be detected. This is achieved despite the low temperature (˜40\,°C) of the solid-phase adsorber and the low thermal desorption temperature of 200\,°C in the TDU unit. It is now shown that automated TED-GC–MS represents a new flexible multi-functional method for comprehensive polymer analyses. Comparable polymer characterization was previously only achievable through a combination of multiple independent analytical methods. This is demonstrated by three examples focused on practical challenges in materials analysis and identification: The first one is the analysis of wood plastic composites for which the decomposition processes of the polymer and the bio polymer (wood) could be clearly distinguished by fractionated collection using sequential adsorbers. Secondly, a fast quantitative application is shown by determining the weight concentrations of an unknown polyolefin blend through comparison with a reference material. Additionally, the determination of microplastic concentrations in environmental samples is becoming an increasingly important analytical necessity. It is demonstrated that with TED-GC–MS calibration curves showing good linearity for the most important precursors for microplastic, even complex matrix materials (suspended particulate matter) can be successfully analyzed.},

  abstract = {Coacervate-based techniques are intensively used in environmental analytical chemistry to enrich and extract different kinds of analytes. Most methods focus on the total content or the speciation of inorganic and organic substances. Size fractionation is less commonly addressed. Within coacervate-based techniques, cloud point extraction (CPE) is characterized by a phase separation of non-ionic surfactants dispersed in an aqueous solution when the respective cloud point temperature is exceeded. In this context, the feature article raises the following question: May CPE in future studies serve as a key tool (i) to enrich and extract nanoparticles (NPs) from complex environmental matrices prior to analyses and (ii) to preserve the colloidal status of unstable environmental samples? With respect to engineered NPs, a significant gap between environmental concentrations and size- and element-specific analytical capabilities is still visible. CPE may support efforts to overcome this “concentration gap” via the analyte enrichment. In addition, most environmental colloidal systems are known to be unstable, dynamic, and sensitive to changes of the environmental conditions during sampling and sample preparation. This delivers a so far unsolved “sample preparation dilemma” in the analytical process. The authors are of the opinion that CPE-based methods have the potential to preserve the colloidal status of these instable samples. Focusing on NPs, this feature article aims to support the discussion on the creation of a convention called the “CPE extractable fraction” by connecting current knowledge on CPE mechanisms and on available applications, via the uncertainties visible and modeling approaches available, with potential future benefits from CPE protocols.},

  abstract = {Due to the widespread use and durability of synthetic polymers, plastic debris occurs in the environment worldwide. In the present work, information on sources and fate of microplastic particles in the aquatic and terrestrial environment, and on their uptake and effects, mainly in aquatic organisms, is reviewed. Microplastics in the environment originate from a variety of sources. Quantitative information on the relevance of these sources is generally lacking, but first estimates indicate that abrasion and fragmentation of larger plastic items and materials containing synthetic polymers are likely to be most relevant. Microplastics are ingested and, mostly, excreted rapidly by numerous aquatic organisms. So far, there is no clear evidence of bioaccumulation or biomagnification. In laboratory studies, the ingestion of large amounts of microplastics mainly led to a lower food uptake and, consequently, reduced energy reserves and effects on other physiological functions. Based on the evaluated data, the lowest microplastic concentrations affecting marine organisms exposed via water are much higher than levels measured in marine water. In lugworms exposed via sediment, effects were observed at microplastic levels that were higher than those in subtidal sediments but in the same range as maximum levels in beach sediments. Hydrophobic contaminants are enriched on microplastics, but the available experimental results and modelling approaches indicate that the transfer of sorbed pollutants by microplastics is not likely to contribute significantly to bioaccumulation of these pollutants. Prior to being able to comprehensively assess possible environmental risks caused by microplastics a number of knowledge gaps need to be filled. However, in view of the persistence of microplastics in the environment, the high concentrations measured at some environmental sites and the prospective of strongly increasing concentrations, the release of plastics into the environment should be reduced in a broad and global effort regardless of a proof of an environmental risk.},

Therefore a method is needed to identify and quantify microplastics in various environmental samples to generate reliable concentration values.

This was achieved by thermal extraction in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), connected to a solid-phase adsorber. These adsorbers were subsequently analysed by thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TDS-GC-MS). In comparison to other chromatographic methods, like pyrolyse gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), the relatively high sample masses in TGA (about 200 times higher than used in Py-GC-MS) analysed here enable the measurement of complex matrices that are not homogenous on a small scale. Through the characteristic decomposition products known for every kind of polymer it is possible to identify and even to quantify polymer particles in various matrices. Polyethylene (PE), one of the most important representatives for microplastics, was chosen as an example for identification and quantification.},

Due to their time consuming procedures and uncertain extrapolation, reliable monitoring is difficult. For analyzing polymers Py-GC-MS is a standard method. However, due to a limited sample amount of about 0.5~mg it is not suited for analysis of complex sample mixtures like environmental samples. Therefore, we developed a new thermoanalytical method as a first step for identifying microplastics in environmental samples. A sample amount of about 20~mg, which assures the homogeneity of the sample, is subjected to complete thermal decomposition. The specific degradation products of the respective polymer are adsorbed on a solid-phase adsorber and subsequently analyzed by thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry. For certain identification, the specific degradation products for the respective polymer were selected first. Afterwards real environmental samples from the aquatic (three different rivers) and the terrestrial (bio gas plant) systems were screened for microplastics. Mainly polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) were identified for the samples from the bio gas plant and PE and PS from the rivers.

Cultivars differing in maturity characteristics were sown in spring at a range of dates in three replicated plot experiments and were used to compare the effects of two plastic mulches and an untreated control: one plastic mulch completely covered the rows (floating); the other had holes punched in the plastic, through which the plants grew (punch). Between April and October 1996 and 1997, the Ontario heat units (OU) received were abr,vc average at 2489 and 2660 respectively; in those years without plastic mulches, the earliest maturing cultivar, Melody, yielded 11.0 and 13.6 t DM ha(-1), with dry-matter contents of 214 and 215 g kg(-1) respectively. Mean daily increases in soil and air temperature under plastic mulches of up to 6 degrees C and 11 degrees C, respectively, were closely related to solar radiation. Under plastic mulches, 15\% fewer OU were required to reach silking, and 33\% more OU were available between silking and harvest. Meaned over three experiments, two years and three cultivars, plastic mulches, when compared with the unmulched control, increased maize yield from 12.0 lo 14.7 t DM ha(-1), cob yield from 3.7 to 6.8 t DM ha(-1), dry matter content from 230 to 270 br kg(-1) and starch content from 198 to 272 g kg(-1). The effect of plastic mulch on the maturation of the crop was greatest at earlier sowings. In 1997, plants from an early sowing date (10 April) that had recently emerged th through the punch plastic mulch were damaged by frost, whereas those in the floating plastic mulch plots were unaffected. When the noting plastic mulch was left on alter the six- to eight-teal stage of the first-early maize cultivar Hudson, the plants were physically damaged and the yield reduced, bur DM and starch contents continued to increase. The increases in yield and dry-marrer content under the plastic mulch were greater in Diamant (second-early cultivar) than in Melody (first-early cultivar). it was concluded thar, under marginal climatic conditions, plastic mulches ought to be used to improve the reliability of early cultivars rather than growing later maturing cultivars.},

This comprises ecosystem-derived organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC), a recalcitrant product Of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Urban topsoils are often enriched in BC from historical emissions of soot and have high TOC concentrations, but the contribution of BC to TOC throughout the urban soil profile, at a regional scale is unknown. We sampled 55 urban soil profiles across the North East of England, a region with a history of coal burning and heavy industry. Through combined elemental and thermogravimetic analyses, we found very large total soil OC stocks (31-65 kg m(-2) to 1 m), exceeding typical values reported for UK woodland soils. BC contributed 28-39\% of the TOC stocks, up to 23 kg C m(-2) to 1 m, and was affected by soil texture. The proportional contribution of the BC-rich fraction to TOC increased with soil depth, and was enriched in topsoil under trees when compared to grassland. Our findings establish the importance of urban ecosystems in storing large amounts of OC in soils and that these soils also capture a large proportion of BC particulates emitted within urban areas.},

Thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography−mass spectrometry allows the fast identification and quantification of MP in environmental samples without sample preparation. Whereas to date only the analysis of thermoplastic polymers has been realized, this is the first time that even the analysis of tire wear (TW) content in environmental samples has been possible. Various marker compounds for TW were identified. They include characteristic decomposition products of elastomers, antioxidants, and vulcanization agents. Advantages and drawbacks of these marker substances were evaluated. Environmental samples from street runoff were exemplarily investigated, and the results are presented.},

Recent sampling campaigns in surface waters revealed substantial numbers of particles in the size range from a few micrometers to a few millimeters. In order to validate sample preparation, identification and quantification and to investigate the behavior of MP particles and potential toxic effects on organisms, defined MP model particles are needed. Many studies use spherical compounds that probably behave differently compared to irregularly shaped MP found in environmental samples. However, preparation and handling of MP particles are challenging tasks and have been systematically investigated in the present study. Polystyrene (PS) as a commonly found polymer with a density slightly above that of water was selected as polymer type for milling and fractionation studies. A cryogenic ball mill proved to be practical and effective to produce particles in the size range from 1 to 200 µm. The yield of small particles increased with increasing pre-cooling and milling durations. Depending on the concentration and the size, PS particles do not completely disperse in water and particles partly creep vertically up along glass walls. Stabilized MP suspensions without use of surfactants that might harm organisms are needed for toxicological studies. The stabilization of PS particle suspensions with ozone treatment reduced the wall effect and increased the number of dispersed PS particles but increased the dissolved organic carbon concentration and changed the size distribution of the particles.},

Films for this application are in the scope of prEN 17098-1[1]. It specifies a classification for durability of mulching films and the test methods referred to in this document.

This document also defines installation, use and removal conditions of mulch films. NOTE Mulch films are considered as highly contaminated by soil and vegetal residues: the observed rates (or levels) of contamination of mulch films can vary from 70 \% to 90 \%. Therefore the film thickness is a key factor on the rate of contamination, the thinnest films (e.g. less than 25 µm) will be the mostly contaminated, difficult, expensive to remove, recover and recycle.}

In this context, electrostatic separation is a new proposition, especially for extracting MP from mineral-rich samples and large sample volumes. However, there is little research evaluating the reliability of the technique. This study has evaluated the effectiveness of the Korona-Walzen-Scheider (KWS) system; a small-scale version of larger machines designed to sort recycling materials. Recovery rates of a variety of sizes of MP, spiked in beach sediments, were found to be highly dependent on the MP size. MP ≥ 2 mm achieved 99 - 100\% recovery (with the exception of fibres: \textasciitilde 80\%), MP of 63 – 450 µm achieved \textasciitilde 60 – 95\% recovery and MP of 20 µm achieved \textasciitilde{} 45\% recovery. For particle-based analysis, additional density separation is still inevitable for the analysis of small MP after KWS separation and further reduces the overall recovery rates. Mass reduction rates of beach and commercial reference sand greatly differed, 93\% and 17\%, respectively. Mineral analysis using SEM-EDX suggested that lower reduction rates found in commercial sand was due to high presence of small ( 450 µm, electrostatic separation is a reliable and fast approach for MP extraction from the environment.},

Expensive data collection causes small sample sizes and oftentimes existing data sets are compared without accounting for natural variability due to hydrodynamic processes governing the distribution of particles. In Warnow estuarine sediments (Germany) we found significant correlations between high-density polymer size fractions (≥500\,µm) and sediment grain size. Among potential predictor variables (source and environmental terms) sediment grain size was the critical proxy for MP abundance. The MP sediment relationship can be explained by the force necessary to start particle transport: at the same level of fluid motion, transported sediment grains and MP particles are offset in size by one to two orders of magnitude. Determining grain-size corrected MP abundances by fractionated granulometric normalisation is recommended as a basis for future MP projections and identification of sinks and sources.},

A key challenge in their detection resides in the relatively inadequate analytical techniques available preventing deep understanding of the fate of nano/microplastics in water. The occurrence of nano/microplastics in water and wastewater treatment plants poses a concern for the quality of the treated water. Due to their broad but small size and diverse chemical natures, nano/microplastics may travel easily along water and wastewater treatment processes infiltrating remediation processes at various levels, representing operational and process stability challenges. This review aims at presenting the current understanding of the fate and impact of nano/microplastics through water and wastewater treatment plants. The formation and fragmentation mechanisms, physical-chemical properties and occurrence of nano/microplastics in water are correlated to the interactions of nano/microplastics with water and wastewater treatment plant processes and potential solutions to limit these interactions are comprehensively reviewed.

Implications by their presence in aquatic and soil ecosystems have been well studied and documented, but less attention has been paid on airborne microplastics (MPs). Studies concerning airborne microplastics started from 2016 and only a few (n = 13) have been published to date. Although, studies may increase in the following years, since air is very important for human survival. Microplastics have been observed in atmospheric fallouts in indoor and outdoor environments using a sampling or vacuum pump, rain sampler, and/or particulate fallout collector. Identification and quantification have been carried out by visual, spectroscopic, and spectrometric techniques. Factors such as meteorological, climatic, and anthropogenic influence the distribution and movement of airborne MP. Human exposure may be through inhalation, dermal, and open meal during fallout, with their potential biopersistence and translocation. Ingestion may cause localized inflammation and cancer due to responses by the immune cells, especially in individuals with compromised metabolism and poor clearance mechanisms. Ecological risks involve possible contamination of the ecosystem through a dynamic relationship of MPs in soil, water, and air forming a MP contamination cycle. The present review aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of current knowledge or information regarding microplastics in air, identifying gap in knowledge, and giving suggestions for future research.},

While environmental contamination is widespread, there are several reasonable intervention points present as the material flows through society and the environment, from initial production to deep-sea microplastic sedimentation. Plastic passes through the hands of many stakeholders, with responsibility for environmental contamination owned, shared, or rejected by plastic producers, product/packaging manufacturers, government, consumers, and waste handlers.The contemporary debate about solutions, in a broad sense, largely contrasts the circular economy with the current linear economic model. While there is a wide agreement that improved waste recovery is essential, how that waste is managed is a different story. The subjective positions of stakeholders illuminate their economic philosophy, whether it is to maintain demand for new plastic by incinerating postconsumer material or maintain material efficacy through recycling, regulated design, and producer responsibility; many proposed solutions fall under linear or circular economic models. Recent efforts to bring often unheard stakeholders to the table, including waste pickers in developing countries, have shed new light on the life cycle of plastic in a social justice context, in response to the growing economic and human health concerns.In this chapter we discuss the main solutions, stakeholder costs, and benefits. We emphasize the role of the “honest broker” in science, to present the best analysis possible to create the most viable solutions to plastic pollution for public and private leadership to utilize.},

Microcosm studies showed that the soil consisted of two contaminant fractions: one available, easily degraded fraction and a strongly sorbed, recalcitrant one. The bioavailable fraction, monitored by headspace solid phase microextraction, contained aromatics with up to three rings, and these were degraded within 20 days down to non-detectable levels (ng PAH/g soil) by both the indigenous bacteria and the externally inoculated samples. The nutrient additives were: a minimal medium (Bushnell-Haas), nitrate, nitrite, potting soil (Änglamark, Sweden), sterile water and aeration with Bushnell-Haas medium. After 30 days treatment most of the sorbed fractions were still present in the soil. Stirring or mechanical mixing of the soil slurries had the greatest effect on degradation, indicating that the substances were too strongly sorbed for the microorganisms. When stirring the choice of nutrient seemed less important. For the non-stirred samples the addition of nitrate with the bacterial inoculum showed the best degradation, compared to the other non-stirred samples. At the end of the experiments, accumulations of metabolites/degradation products, such as 9H-fluorenone, 4-hydroxy-9H-fluorenone, 9,10-phenanthrenedione and 4H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthrenone were detected. The metabolite 4-hydroxy-9H-fluorenone increased by several orders of magnitude during the biological treatments.

  abstract = {Many of the environmental, occupational and industrial chemicals are able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause oxidative stress. ROS may lead to genotoxicity, which is suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including inflammatory diseases and cancer. Phthalates are ubiquitous environmental chemicals and are well-known peroxisome proliferators (PPs) and endocrine disruptors. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have been conducted concerning the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of phthalates. Di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) and several other phthalates are shown to be hepatocarcinogenic in rodents. The underlying factor in the hepatocarcinogenesis is suggested to be their ability to generate ROS and cause genotoxicity. Several methods, including chromosomal aberration test, Ames test, micronucleus assay and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) mutation test and Comet assay, have been used to determine genotoxic properties of phthalates. Comet assay has been an important tool in the measurement of the genotoxic potential of many chemicals, including phthalates. In this review, we will mainly focus on the studies, which were conducted on the DNA damage caused by different phthalate esters and protection studies against the genotoxicity of these chemicals.}

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may not effectively remove microplastics allowing for their release to the freshwater environment. To investigate concentration of microplastic in fresh water and the impact of WWTP effluent, samples were collected upstream and downstream of four major municipal WWTPs on the Raritan River, NJ. Microplastics were categorized into three quantitative categories (500–2000~μm, 250–500~μm, 125–250~μm), and one semi-quantitative category (63–125~μm). Then, microplastics were classified as primary (manufactured in small size) or secondary (derived from larger plastics) based on morphology. The concentration of microplastics in the 125–250 and 250–500~μm size categories significantly increased downstream of WWTP. The smaller size classes, often not quantified in microplastic studies, were in high relative abundance across sampling sites. While primary microplastics significantly increased downstream of WWTP, secondary microplastic was the dominant type in the quantitative size categories (66–88\%). A moderate correlation between microplastic and distance downstream was observed. These results have implications for understanding the fate and transport of microplastics in the freshwater environment.},

Pyrograms exhibited a multitude of peaks deriving from the thermal degradation of natural organic matter (humic substances, planktonic material), artificial resins and synthetic rubbers. Upon pyrolysis, sediments generated high levels of styrene and benzene and a series of aromatic hydrocarbons (α-methylstyrene, indene, naphthalenes, biphenyl, diphenylpropane) indicative of the presence of vinyl polymers (e.g. poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene), whereas markers for rubbers (butadiene dimer, styrene-butadiene) were identified in pyrograms of SPM. Concentrations of styrene polymers (expressed as polystyrene, PS) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were estimated in sediment cores by Py-GC-MS using the evolved benzene and styrene for quantitation, and values greater than 1mg/g were observed in the most polluted layers. Plastic materials were isolated from sediments by Soxhlet-extraction with dichloromethane followed by precipitation in n-hexane and analysed by Py-GC-MS and spectroscopic techniques (1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, FTIR). PVC made up the bulk of the isolated polymers which were found at concentrations up to 55mg/g. PVC concentrations determined by both methods (direct pyrolysis and polymer extraction), showed maxima in subsurface strata and were strongly correlated with Hg concentrations. This finding suggests that the presence of resins is due to past industrial activity, even though the identification of styrene-plastic rubbers in SPM indicates that polymers are still redistributed and/or discharged into the lagoon.},

The mussel tissues were treated with 10 \% KOH at 90 °C with good digestion efficiency (97 ± 1 \%) and extracted with toluene. After evaporation the residue was pyrolysed at 500 °C with a resistively heated platinum filament. Pyrolysis products were trapped onto a charcoal cartridge, eluted with toluene and analysed by GC–MS under selected ion monitoring. Polystyrene concentrations were determined by the internal standard method from the peak areas of styrene. The procedure provided information on the effect of particle size, exposure level and tissue type on the bioaccumulation of polystyrene particles in terms of mass concentrations. Accumulation was observed in digestive glands, not in gills. The accumulation of larger particles in digestive glands increased with increasing concentrations of polystyrene in water and peaked at 14 ± 4 μg g−1. The reduction of lysosome membrane stability was observed for both particles size at a water concentration of 10,000 particles per litre, that corresponded to a lower mass concentration for the smaller particles. This study confirmed the capability of analytical pyrolysis to provide microplastic concentrations in terms of mass concentration in complex matrices.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs), pharmaceuticals and pesticides are emerging pollutants with proposed negative impacts on the environment. Rising interest in investigations of MPs is likely related to their potential to accumulate in agricultural systems as the base of the food chain. We applied an integrated approach using classic bioassays and molecular methods to evaluate the impact associated with a mixture of three types of polyethylene (PE) microbeads, namely, white (W), blue (B), and fluorescent blue (FB), and their interactions with pollutants (OCs), including ibuprofen (IB), sertraline (STR), amoxicillin (AMX) and simazine (SZ), on different soil organisms. PE-MPs exhibited different abilities for the adsorption of each OC; W selectively adsorbed higher amounts of SZ, whereas B and FB preferably retained AMX. Standard soil was artificially contaminated with OCs and MPs (alone or combined with OCs) and incubated for 30 days. The presence of MPs or MPs and OCs (MIX) in soil did not produce any effect on Caenorhabditis elegans endpoint growth, reproduction, or survival. Inhibition of leaf growth in Zea mays was detected, but this negative effect declined over time, while the inhibition of root growth increased, especially when OCs (32\%) or MIX (47\%) were added. Moreover, the expression of the antioxidant genes CAT 1, SOD-1A and GST 1 on plants was affected by the treatments studied. The addition of MPs or MIX significantly affected the soil bacterial phylogenetic profile, which selectively enriched members of the bacterial community (particularly Proteobacteria). The predicted functional profiles of MP/MIX samples indicated a potential impact on the carbon and nitrogen cycle within the soil environment. Our results indicate that MPs and their capability to act as pollutant carriers affect soil biota; further studies should be carried out on the bioavailability of OCs adsorbed by microplastics and how long it takes to leach these OCs into different organisms and/or ecosystems.},

Biofouling by marine biota is one possible mechanism responsible for this discrepancy. Microplastics ({$<$}5~mm in diameter) are more scarce than larger size classes, which makes sense because fouling is a function of surface area whereas buoyancy is a function of volume; the smaller an object, the greater its relative surface area. We tested whether plastic items with high surface area to volume ratios sank more rapidly by submerging 15 different sizes of polyethylene samples in False Bay, South Africa, for 12 weeks to determine the time required for samples to sink. All samples became sufficiently fouled to sink within the study period, but small samples lost buoyancy much faster than larger ones. There was a direct relationship between sample volume (buoyancy) and the time to attain a 50\% probability of sinking, which ranged from 17 to 66 days of exposure. Our results provide the first estimates of the longevity of different sizes of plastic debris at the ocean surface. Further research is required to determine how fouling rates differ on free floating debris in different regions and in different types of marine environments. Such estimates could be used to improve model predictions of the distribution and abundance of floating plastic debris globally.},

  abstract = {Management of soil organic matter (SOM) is esential to sustaining the quality and productivity of soils around the globe. This appears to be particularly true in the tropics where there is a greater proportion of nutrient poor, highly weathered soils that are more susceptible to losses of SOM. Developing management practices that promote the maintenance and storage of SOM in the tropics depends on understanding the factors that control SOM dynamics. This paper describes the role that soil physical properties (mineralogy, texture, and structure) play in regulating the accumulation and loss of SOM in tropical soils. Two different approaches are presented here. The first approach explores relationships between total SOM and soil physical properties in the tropics. These include effects of climate and mineralogy on latitudinal gradients in SOM, interactions between texture and mineralogy as determinants of SOM storage and relationships between SOM and the structural stability of soils. The second approach describes characteristics of SOM associated with different physical constituents of the soil, with particular attention to particle-size fractions and aggregated particles of different sizes. In each case we summarise findings on the distribution of SOM among fractions and characterise its biochemical composition, bioavailability and turnover. Evidence for and against the physical protection of organic matter from microbial attack in tropical soils is also given. Wherever possible, we compare and contrast the findings for tropical soils with those of temperate soils.

  abstract = {Numerous studies on microplastics (MPs; Ø~{$<~$}5~mm) in the aquatic environment have been published, but knowledge about the occurrence and ecological risks of MPs is limited. This is in part because current data on the distribution of MPs are comparable only to a limited extent, due to the many different methods of investigation. In addition, sample preparation is often difficult such that standard procedures are lacking. The aim of this work was to simplify the preparation of different kinds of MP samples. Our method makes use of the electrostatic behavior of plastic particles to facilitate their separation from sample matter, with up to 99\% of the original sample mass removed without any loss of MPs. To determine the efficacy of this approach, four different materials (quartz sand, freshwater suspended particulate matter, freshwater sediment, and beach sand) were spiked with MPs (size: 0.063–5~mm from the seven most common types of plastics, one bioplastic type, polyethylene fibers, and tire wear. A modified electrostatic metal/plastic separator was used to reduce the sample mass and concentrate the plastics based on their physical separation. The recovery achieved with this method was as high as nearly 100\% for each type of material. The method was then tested on plastic particles of different shapes and types isolated from the Rhine River. These were successfully electroseparated from the four materials, which demonstrated the utility of this method. Its advantages include the simplified handling and preparation of different field samples as well as a much shorter processing time, because after the last separation step there is hardly any biological material remaining in the sample fraction.},

This work investigated the MPs in the farmland and grassland at a remote area of China, namely, the eastern area of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP). The average numbers of MPs were 53.2~±~29.7 and 43.9~±~22.3 items/kg in shallow and deep soil, respectively, from 35 soil samples. A remarkable difference in MP abundances was observed among soil samples from mulch farmland, greenhouses, farmland without covering, and grassland. The MPs were mostly in the form of a film and transparent in color in this study. The dominant polymers of MPs in the soil samples were polyester (PE) and polypropylene (PP). This study revealed the characteristics of MP distribution among different land use at the QTP, and MPs may stem from the fragmentation of plastic mulch in farmland soil. Notably, MP abundance increased with the increase in mulching time in facility agriculture. Additionally, human disturbances and increased mulching time in facility agriculture promote the fragmentation of soil MPs. This study provides important data for follow-up research on MPs in a plateau terrestrial ecosystem.},

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of these disinfection techniques on the degradation of eight fungicides (azoxystrobin, kresoxin methyl, tebuconazole, hexaconazole, triadimenol, cyprodinil, pyrimethanil and fludioxonil) commonly used in pepper crops under greenhouse cultivation. Seventy-five 17-L pots filled with clay-loam soil were placed in a greenhouse during the summer season and then contaminated with the studied fungicides. Treatments consisted of different disinfection treatments, including a control without disinfection, solarization and biosolarization. For the solarization and biosolarization treatments, low-density polyethylene film was used as cover. Five pots per treatment were sampled periodically up to 90d after the beginning of each treatment and fungicide residues were analyzed by GC/MS. The results showed that both solarization and biosolarization enhanced fungicide dissipation rates with regard to the control treatment, an effect which was attributed to the increased soil temperature. Most of the fungicides studied showed similar behavior under solarization and biosolarization conditions. However, triadimenol was degraded to a greater extent in the biosolarization than in the solarization treatment, while fludioxonil behaved in the opposite way. The results confirm that both solarization and biosolarization contribute to pesticide dissipation and can therefore be considered alongside other soil disinfection techniques, as a bioremediation tool for pesticide-polluted soils.},

All materials were sterilized and inoculated with either of two different species of white rot fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium or Coriolus versicolor, and incubated in sealed bottles at 28°C. The CO2 concentration in the jars was periodically determined using an infrared gas analyzer and its isotopic (13C) signature was assessed using a trace gas (ANCA TGII) module coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS, Europa 20-20). L. perenne material inoculated with C. versicolor showed the highest C mineralization activity with approximately 70\% of total C evolved as CO2 after 76 days of incubation, followed by glucose. Substrates inoculated with C. versicolor generally decomposed faster than when degraded by P. chrysosporium, except for lignin, where no significant differences between the two fungi types were found and CO2-C released was less than 2\% of the initial C. Considerable 13C isotopic fractionation during the degradation of plant tissue and of pure biochemical compounds was revealed as well as progressive shifts in cumulative CO2-13C isotopic signatures over time. During the first stages of decomposition, the CO2-C released was usually depleted in 13C as compared with the initial solid substrate, but with ongoing decomposition the CO2-C evolved became progressively more enriched in 13C. P. chrysosporium usually showed a slightly higher 13C fractionation than C. versicolor during the first decomposition phase. At posterior decomposition stages isotopic discrimination was often stronger by C. versicolor. These findings on isotopic 13C discrimination during microbial degradation both of simple biochemical compounds and of complex vegetal tissue confirmed not only the existence of significant 13C isotopic fractionation during plant residue decomposition, but also the existence of non-random isotopic distribution within substrates. They also demonstrated the ability of microorganisms to selectively discriminate against 13C even when degrading an isolated simple substrate. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Environmental context Microplastics, either purposefully manufactured or formed by fragmentation of discarded ‘end-of-life’ macroplastic items, are accumulating in environmental compartments. As more and more data are collected on microplastics in the environment, discussion of two issues has become indispensable: (i) how reliable are the results in terms of the inherent capabilities and limitations of current methods used for sampling, counting and measuring microplastic particles; and (ii) how can the fate of microplastics be understood in the context of natural particles and colloids? Abstract A first important step in evaluating the impact of microplastic pollution in natural systems is assessing the reliability of the results obtained according to the inherent capabilities and limitations of the methods used for sampling, counting and measuring microplastic particles. This study, based on the critical reading of 55 studies containing quantitative microplastic data in waters and sediments, is an attempt to analyse these issues in the light of existing knowledge in the field of natural colloid studies. Existing results are highly dependent on the sampling and methodological procedure chosen and are essentially descriptive. Moreover, often they lack standardisation and adequate reporting of basic information such as the meaning of the size parameter measured. Colloid theory may provide the theoretical background needed to explain microplastic behaviour or, at least, to identify the parameters (e.g. density, surface characteristics, shape) that need to be known in order to gain a predictive knowledge of the subject. They are introduced and discussed. Finally, microplastics are not alone in environmental compartments. For this reason, when possible, published microplastic particle size distributions in natural waters have been quantitatively situated in the context of natural particles.},

The presented method improvements emphasize the potential of pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (Py-GCMS) methods for mass-related MP quantification in environmental samples. A previously established Curie-Point (CP)-pyrolyzer is compared to a micro furnace (MF) pyrolyzer of higher sample capacity. The two Py-GCMS systems are examined in terms of calibration aspects like dynamic range, linearity, process standard deviation and overall sensitivity. Here, MF-PyGCMS provided advantages. Depending on the samples and their residual organic matrix content, the related pyrolysis products may interact with relevant indicator ions of interesting polymers. This can hamper or even impede any calibration and quantification of MP in the given sample. An internal standard mixture added just before the pyrolysis process (ISTDpy) mimics these interactions to a certain extent. Based on selected peak ratios, ISTDpy offers a possible quantification option in those cases. The application in selected environmental samples (sea salt, surface water and muddy sediment) after adequate preconcentration illustrates the capability and sensitivity of MF-Py-GCMS for MP-quantification regarding the encountered concentrations (ppt–ppm).},

  abstract = {Plastic mulching has become a well established technique for increasing the profitability of many horticultural crops. Large yield increases have also been achieved by using plastic mulching on rainfed maize, often more than doubling yields. At current grain prices, however, the increase in maize yields obtained through the use of plastic mulching have not been sufficient to cover the cost of the traditional mulching system where the plastic mulch is replaced annually. It has also not generally been considered technologically nor agronomically practical to reuse plastic mulch under the traditional mulching systems. For these reasons a new system referred to as â€˜semi-permanent plastic mulchingâ€™ is proposed here. This system which leaves the plastic mulch in situ for a period of years, combines improved water management, decreased risk of soil erosion, higher yields, and improved sustainability, all in an economically viable system. Semi-permanent plastic mulching is most suitable for regions where the shortage and unreliability of rainfall are the greatest constraints to increasing yields. The system has been tested using rainfed maize in a semi-arid region of Mexico and resulted in yields which were significantly higher than the control non-mulching treatment and which were similar to those achieved using traditional plastic mulching systems.},

Franco]. We conducted a 2-year study with 350 seedlings to assess the effects of twelve soil-shading, mulching, and vegetation control techniques on seedling growth and soil temperature and moisture environments. Treatments modified a variety of environmental conditions. Major effects of treatments were to lower soil surface temperature, reduce soil surface evaporation, and reduce vegetative competition for soil water. These modified conditions affected seedlings by adjusting the timing of seedling growth and reducing soil water loss to increase available water for seedling use. Final seedling shoot volume and stem diameter both differed among treatments. Seedlings in treatments where competing vegetation was controlled showed significantly greater growth than seedlings in other treatments. Soil water loss in treatments where either soil surface evaporation was controlled by mulching, or where competing vegetation was controlled, was significantly less than water loss from the shaded and control treatments. Soil water loss in treatments with vegetation controlled by herbicide was significantly less than in treatments with vegetation controlled by scalping. Seedlings showed greatest growth with treatments that elicited the most efficient use of available microsite water either by reducing soil surface evaporation or vegetation competition.},

  abstract = {Currently, non-biodegradable oil-based plastics are gradually being replaced by bio-based biodegradable plastics to prevent the formation of microplastics. For biodegradable materials to decompose completely, however, they require specific conditions that are rarely met in ecosystems. Paradoxically, this may lead to the fast production of microplastics from biodegradable materials, i.e. micro-bioplastics. Until recently, the scientific focus has been solely on the estimation of conventional microplastics. As a result, there is a lack of analytical methods for determining the amount of micro-bioplastics in soil. In this review, we address this problem by summarising sample pre-treatments and analytical techniques suitable for the determination of conventional microplastics, which serve as inspiration for the determination of micro-bioplastics from polyhydroxybutyrates, polylactic acid and polybutylene adipate terephthalate in soil. The analytical techniques include both pyrolysis-based techniques, i.e. thermoanalytical and non-thermoanalytical approaches including sample pre-separation and respective detection limits. We conclude that due to the incomplete knowledge of the production rate of micro-bioplastics, fate, sorption properties and toxicity, it is necessary to develop and validate a rapid and suitable method for their determination. Indeed, the use of thermoanalytical approaches seems to be the most promising strategy. Furthermore, we suggest how the development and analysis of micro-bioplastics should be addressed in future research.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable tosses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.}

  abstract = {A variety of organic materials (e.g. composts, paper recycling wastes, hay) can be used as in-row mulches in perennial horticultural cropping systems such as high density apple orchards. As organic materials with variable properties, such mulches can be expected to have variable effects on structure of the soil food web and mineralisation of N and P in the root zone. The overall objectives of this study were to: (1) assess the effects of a selection of organic mulches on the abundance of protozoa and nematode trophic groups; (2) use the model of Hunt et al. [Biol. Fertil. Soils 3 (1987) 393] to assess the implications of changes in microfaunal abundance for microbial turnover and N mineralisation; and (3) determine effects of the mulches on nematode indicators of increased microbial production/turnover and functional diversity of the soil food web. Organic mulch treatments commenced in 1994 and included shredded office paper, municipal biosolids, shredded paper applied over municipal biosolids, shredded paper applied over municipal compost, alfalfa hay, and black polyethylene fabric. The control was conventional tree-row weed management with glyphosate. Biosolids and municipal compost treatments were re-applied in 1997. Protozoan abundance was determined in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Nematode community structure was assessed in 1998, 1999, and twice in 2000. Nematode community parameters evaluated included: abundance of bacterivorous, fungivorous, omnivorous and predacious nematodes; abundance of the root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans; absolute and relative abundances of enrichment opportunist nematodes (Rhabditidae+Diplogasteridae+Panagrolaimidae); Simpson’s diversity; evenness; and the indices of nematode community enrichment (EI) and structure (SI) described by Ferris et al. [Appl. Soil Ecol. 18 (2001) 13]. Measurements of the abundance of enrichment opportunists and the EI were evaluated as indicators of enhanced nutrient fluxes. Diversity and the SI were evaluated as indicators of changes in functional diversity of the soil food web. The abundance of protozoa and bacterivorous nematodes, and estimated fluxes of N and P through the microfauna, were greater under all combinations of biosolids or municipal compost and shredded paper than under the control and plastic mulch. The abundance of enrichment opportunist nematodes and the EI were also consistently greater under combinations of biosolids or municipal compost and shredded paper. The abundance of enrichment opportunists and EI were both also correlated with leaf P, providing additional evidence to support the use of these parameters as indicators of enhanced turnover of microbial biomass and nutrients. The SI was greatest under shredded paper and shredded paper applied over municipal compost, and least under municipal biosolids and alfalfa hay. Population densities of P. penetrans were reduced under shredded paper mulch relative to the control and biosolids alone.},

The volunteers filtered 100~L of river water through a 100-μm mesh at their desired location along the Ottawa River. All but one of the river samples (n\,=\,43) contained microplastics, with the vast majority of microplastics identified as microfibers. Microplastic concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 0.41 microplastic pieces per litre. We noted numerous advantages in working with citizen scientists including actively engaging citizens in the research, ease of recruiting volunteers within the established Ottawa Riverkeeper network, and expanded spatial coverage at minimal additional costs. Despite these important advantages, there are some important considerations with citizen scientist sampling including the rare events where volunteers mislabelled sample sheets (e.g. labelling as control instead of river sample) and the relatively low volume of water (100~L) that the volunteers could easily sample using our methodology. Recommendations for future citizen science projects for freshwater microplastic research include utilising an established and engaged network, running both field and lab control samples (blanks) to obtain estimates of contamination with microplastic fibres, and increasing the amount of water filtered to obtain more reliable estimates of microplastic pollution in our freshwater ecosystems.},

A large number of microplastics, the majority of which were smaller than 10 μm, were identified in the effluent of the advanced filtration systems with polyethylene the most common polymer identified.

  abstract = {Soil quality is a concept based on the premise that management can deteriorate, stabilize, or improve soil ecosystem functions. It is hypothesized that the degree of stratification of soil organic C and N pools with soil depth, expressed as a ratio, could indicate soil quality or soil ecosystem functioning, because surface organic matter is essential to erosion control, water infiltration, and conservation of nutrients. Stratification ratios allow a wide diversity of soils to be compared on the same assessment scale because of an internal normalization procedure that accounts for inherent soil differences. Stratification ratios of soil organic C were 1.1, 1.2 and 1.9 under conventional tillage (CT) and 3.4, 2.0 and 2.1 under no tillage (NT) in Georgia, Texas, and Alberta/British Columbia, respectively. The difference in stratification ratio between conventional and NT within an environment was inversely proportional to the standing stock of soil organic C to a depth of 15–20 cm across environments. Greater stratification of soil C and N pools with the adoption of conservation tillage under inherently low soil organic matter conditions (i.e., warmer climatic regime or coarse-textured soil) suggests that standing stock of soil organic matter alone is a poor indication of soil quality. Stratification of biologically active soil C and N pools (i.e., soil microbial biomass and potential activity) were equally or more sensitive to tillage, cropping intensity, and soil textural variables than stratification of total C and N. High stratification ratios of soil C and N pools could be good indicators of dynamic soil quality, independent of soil type and climatic regime, because ratios \&gt;2 would be uncommon under degraded conditions.},

Such characterizations were usually of a qualitative nature, and any semiquantitative assessments of individual compounds were often achieved by measuring relative areas and assuming unity as a response factor. In this paper we evaluate the quantitative measurement of many identified products characteristic of lignin and NOM using an internal standard approach. The relative standard deviation for most quantified compounds was between 1 and 10\%. Four NOM samples, isolated by low-temperature, low-pressure evaporation and freeze-drying, were collected from temperate as well as tropical climates. Large variations were found between samples with respect to the distribution of compounds such as fatty acids, lignin-derived compounds, carbohydrate-derived compounds, and protein-derived compounds. We quantified most lignin-derived and aromatic TMAH products as well as fatty acids (as their methyl esters, FAME) that were found in this set of NOM samples. The contribution of lignin-derived compounds to the total quantified TMAH product distribution in these four samples varied between 21 and 35\%. The contribution of FAMEs ranged from 32 to 51\% whereas the contribution from non-lignin aromatic compounds was 24–32\%. TMAH thermochemolysis potentially provides significant information about NOM sources, compared with other degradative techniques, since both lignin-derived compounds and lipids can be quantitatively and simultaneously investigated.},

Several animal studies have shown that some phthalates possess endocrine disrupting effects. Some of the effects of phthalates seen in rats are due to testosterone lowering effects on the foetal testis and they are similar to those seen in humans with testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Therefore, exposure of the human foetus and infants to phthalates via maternal exposure is a matter of concern. The metabolic pathways of phthalate metabolites excreted in human urine are partly known for some phthalates, but our knowledge about metabolic distribution in the body and other biological fluids, including breast milk, is limited. Compared to urine, human breast milk contains relatively more of the hydrophobic phthalates, such as di-n-butyl phthalate and the longer-branched, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP); and their monoester metabolites. Urine, however, contains relatively more of the secondary metabolites of DEHP and DiNP, as well as the monoester phthalates of the more short-branched phthalates. This differential distribution is of special concern as, in particular, the hydrophobic phthalates and their metabolites are shown to have adverse effects following in utero and lactational exposures in animal studies.},

  abstract = {The concentration and spatial distribution of microplastics in the Bay of Brest (Brittany, France) was investigated in two surveys. Surface water and sediment were sampled at nine locations in areas characterized by contrasting anthropic pressures, riverine influences or water mixing. Microplastics were categorized by their polymer type and size class. Microplastic contamination in surface water and sediment was dominated by polyethylene fragments (PE, 53–67\%) followed by polypropylene (PP, 16–30\%) and polystyrene (PS, 16–17\%) microparticles. The presence of buoyant microplastics (PE, PP and PS) in sediment suggests the existence of physical and/or biological processes leading to vertical transfer of lightweight microplastics in the bay. In sediment (upper 5~cm), the percentage of particles identified by Raman micro-spectroscopy was lower (41\%) than in surface water (79\%) and may explain the apparent low concentration observed in this matrix (0.97~±~2.08~MP~kg−1 dry sediment). Mean microplastic concentration was 0.24~±~0.35~MP~m−3 in surface water. We suggest that the observed spatial MP distribution is related to proximity to urbanized areas and to hydrodynamics in the bay. A particle dispersal model was used to study the influence of hydrodynamics on surface microplastic distribution. The outputs of the model showed the presence of a transitional convergence zone in the centre of the bay during flood tide, where floating debris coming from the northern and southern parts of the bay tends to accumulate before being expelled from the bay. Further modelling work and observations integrating (i) the complex vertical motion of microplastics, and (ii) their point sources is required to better understand the fate of microplastics in such a complex coastal ecosystem.},

By variation of the PEDOT:PSS layer thickness between 25 and 150 nm, we found optimum device performance, in particular low dark current and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and open-circuit voltage (Voc), at around 70 nm. This has been observed for two different active layers. Annealing studies on the PEDOT:PSS films, with temperatures varied between 120 and 400 °C, showed an optimum device performance, in particular EQE and Voc at 250 °C. This optimum performance was found to be associated with loss of water from the PSS shell of the PEDOT:PSS grains. For annealing temperatures above 260 °C, device performance was dramatically reduced. This was associated with chemical decomposition leading to loss of sulfonic acid, although this did not significantly affect the in-plane conductivity.},

  abstract = {Any assessment of plastic contamination in the marine environment requires knowledge of the polymer type and the additive content of microplastics. Sequential pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS) was applied to simultaneously identify polymer types of microplastic particles and associated organic plastic additives (OPAs). In addition, a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyser was used to identify the inorganic plastic additives (IPAs) contained in these particles. A total of ten particles, which were optically identified as potentially being plastics, were extracted from two sediment samples collected from Norderney, a North Sea island, by density separation in sodium chloride. The weights of these blue, white and transparent fragments varied between 10 and 350 μg. Polymer types were identified by comparing the resulting pyrograms with those obtained from the pyrolysis of selected standard polymers. The particles consisted of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, chlorinated PE and chlorosulfonated PE. The polymers contained diethylhexyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, benzaldehyde and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. Sequential Py-GC/MS was found to be an appropriate tool for identifying marine microplastics for polymer types and OPAs. The IPAs identified were titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs), barium, sulphur and zinc. When polymer–TiO2 composites are degraded in the marine environment, TiO2-NPs are probably released. Thus, marine microplastics may act as a TiO2-NP source, which has not yet been considered.},

Compared with pristine microplastics, the natural-aged microplastics were more efficient for adsorbing Pb(II). After treated by hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the organic film was damaged and the adsorption efficiency decreased obviously, which proved that the organic film played an important role in Pb(II) capture. The fitting results of the isothermal adsorption model showed that this adsorption process was more in line with Langmuir model than with Freundlich model, and the maximum adsorption amount (13.60~mg/g) could also be obtained from the Langmuir model. Based on the comprehensive analysis of XRD, XPS and FTIR results, it was found that Pb(II) capture by natural-aged microplastics was mainly determined by the oxygen containing functional groups (carboxyl and hydroxyl groups) on the organic film. Besides, the measurement results of Zeta potential and pH effect showed that electrostatic interaction was mainly responsible for the Pb(II) capture process.},

In the past years an increasing attention has been addressed to investigate the presence and concentration of plastic debris in the ecosystems, including surface waters. Scientific literature extensively describes the ingestion by aquatic fauna, the transfer into food webs and the potential action as a vector for toxic compounds or alien microorganisms. Although the scientific community addresses this issue with considerable effort, many questions remain open. In particular, new sources of microplastics have been recently recognized, possibly representing major environmental inputs compared to those previously considered. In addition to the already renowned sources such as the embrittlement of plastic litter and microbeads released from personal care products, microplastic can be released also by washing of synthetic clothes, abrasion of vehicles tyres and from the weathering of different kind of paints. This review tries to exhaustively enumerate all the possible sources of plastic litter that have been identified so far and to report quantitative assessments of their inputs on microplastics pollution to natural environments reported in scientific and grey literature, with an emphasis on surface waters.},

Calibration was conducted with an autumn–winter soil-grown crop, and validation with five crops with differences in season, cropping media, and site. VegSyst accurately simulated daily dry matter production (DMP), N uptake, and ETc. Comparing simulated and measured values by linear regression, slope and intercept values were not statistically significantly different (P {$<$} 0.05) from 1 and 0, respectively. Slopes between simulated and measured values indicated average differences of 4, 2, and −1 \% for DMP, N uptake, and ETc, respectively. Model performance was good with autumn–winter and spring cropping cycles, and in soil and substrate. A prototype decision support system (VegSyst-DSS) based on VegSyst was developed to calculate daily irrigation and N fertilizer requirements and nutrient solution [N] for fertigated tomato. N fertilizer requirements are based on crop N uptake and consider soil mineral N, and N mineralized from manure and soil OM and the N efficiency of each N source. Irrigation requirements are based on ETc and consider application efficiency and salinity. VegSyst-DSS requires very few inputs which are all readily available to farmers and advisors. Scenario analysis compared a scenario representative of local farming practice, where N supplied from soil is not considered, with scenarios with different amounts of N supplied from soil mineral N at planting and mineralization of soil OM and of manure. Relative to the scenario representative of farmer practice, VegSyst recommendations resulted in reductions of 34–65 \% in fertilizer N.},

  abstract = {Increasing food demands by a growing human population require substantial increases in crop productivity. In rain-fed arid and semiarid areas where the water supply is limited, an increase in the precipitation use efficiency (PUE) is the key to reach this goal. This chapter examines the scientific basis of a ridge-furrow mulching system (RF system) for increasing PUE, and summarizes the effects of this system on crop performance, microclimates, soil attributes, and environmental sustainability. Studies have shown that using crop straw, plastic film, or gravel–sand materials to mulch the soil surface significantly reduces the evaporation of soil moisture, increases water availability to crop plants, and decreases soil erosion caused by wind and water. Plastic mulching increases topsoil temperature during cool spring, promoting plant growth; during hot summer, straw mulching can moderate soil temperature, preventing the topsoil from reaching temperatures that inhibit plant growth. Ridge furrows with plastic mulching on the ridges and crop straw covering the furrows channel water to the furrows, and enhance soil water infiltration and water availability to the crop. Microclimates under mulched ridges and furrows favor soil microbial activity, increase soil biodiversity, and improve environmental benefits. The effectiveness of ridge-furrow systems is reflected in increased crop yields (20–180\%) compared with that of the conventional-flat planting. Although more research is required to document physiochemical strengths, technique details and potential drawbacks, and more importantly to define long-term sustainability, we strongly suggest that RF systems are an innovative approach for increasing crop water availability, improving soil productivity, and enhancing food security for arid and semiarid rain-fed areas.},

Plastic mulching technology can effectively modify the crop growth environment and crop production due to differences in climatic conditions, spatial distribution characteristics, and cropping systems and methods. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively analyze the effects of plastic film mulching and residual plastic on yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize, wheat, potato, and cotton in China based on 266 peer-reviewed publications. The results showed that plastic mulching significantly increased crop yield (24.32\%) and WUE (27.63\%). Plastic mulching had the greatest effect of potato on yield (30.62\%) and WUE (30.34\%) in China. At a regional scale, plastic mulching performed best in Northwest China, and crop yield and WUE were influenced by film color, mulching method, and crop type. Black film and ridge row mulching were more favorable to crop growth and increased crop yield and WUE in arid areas of China. There was no significant effect on crop yield of residual plastic between 0 and 240 kg/ha, but the yield decreased significantly with increased time and residual plastic film {$>$}240 kg/ha. In conclusion, although plastic mulching can significantly increase crop yield and WUE, especially in dryland agriculture, we should also improve the technology for recovering residual plastic film to protect the environment.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with an experimental study of various techniques that have been applied for soil disinfestation purposes under greenhouse conditions. Various meteorological parameters and soil temperatures were measured for four different experimental soil segments (three associated with different disinfestation techniques and one as a reference) at depths varying between 0-1 m and with a time interval of 5 min in a greenhouse located in the Agricultural University of Athens Campus, Greece. Results showed that plastic polyethylene films such as covers, metallic conductors or a combination of both were able to enhance heat transfer and temperature increase in greenhouse soil. For typical disinfestation conditions, the depth-averaged temperature values for plastic covers, metallic conductors, and the combination of both were found to be higher than those for the reference of about 5 degrees C, 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the remained population percentages 50 days after the initiation of the experiment were found to be 19.3\%, 25.3\%, 37.3\% kappa alpha iota 94\% of the initial population, for the combination of metallic conductors and plastic covers, metallic conductors, plastic cover, and for the reference, respectively.},

  abstract = {Soils are an essential resource in both managed and natural systems, and maintaining soil quality is critical to the development of sustainable development of human activities, in particular agriculture. The assessment of impacts of human activities on soil quality needs a universal practical approach that can be incorporated in global environmental assessments. But so far, no synthetic indicators have been proposed that would combine the main soil characteristics in a simple formula valid for all types of soils and climates. The existence of numerous interrelated soil characteristics and their complex interactions with agricultural practices has postponed development of a universal soil-quality impact indicator in environmental assessment, especially in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is an internationally normalized method widely used to evaluate potential impacts of products. The inability to represent impacts on soil quality remains one of the unresolved problems in LCA because of soil's spatial and temporal variability and the complex interactions between soil properties. It is crucial to consider soil quality in the environmental assessment of products, especially those with a majority of their life cycle in biological processes (such as agriculture and forestry). After presenting a general overview of the soil quality concept, we review the existing LCA approaches that consider soil quality in their inventory and impact-assessment phases, and outline the challenges to refining soil quality impacts in LCA. These challenges include estimation of complex soil quality impacts that depend on fluctuating soil characteristics, consideration of both on-site and off-site agricultural soils, and aggregation of impacts both spatially and temporally. The inventory items describing soil quality can be soil properties, functions or processes (e.g., erosion, compaction). Their quantification implies that they be (1) relevant for calculating impacts on soil quality, (2) related to one or more functional units, (3) as accurate as possible and (4) calculated with available data at a global scale. Inventory items based on processes fulfill these four needs and can be considered as midpoint indicators in LCA. Furthermore, indicators based on processes allow an incremental improvement of the method through the inclusion of new impacts. Efforts first must focus on developing robust impact indicators for individual soil processes before attempting to aggregate them into a single indicator. Nonetheless, several aggregation approaches are presented. The appropriate level of complexity and comprehensiveness for assessing impacts on soil quality should result from a compromise between oversimplified and overcomplicated descriptions of the multiple functions and properties of soils.},

  abstract = {Purpose Increasing soil organic matter content is important in improving soil fertility; however, conventional farming practices generally lead to a reduction in such organic material. A comparative study of organic and conventional arable farming systems was conducted in Shanghai, China, to determine the influence of management practices on soil chemistry, microbial activity, and biomass. Soils used in greenhouses and open field cultivation were obtained from plots subjected to organic farming methods for 3 years or from conventionally farmed fields in the same area. Materials and methods Four combinations of field type and management system were evaluated: (1) organic management in open fields (ORG-OP); (2) conventional management in open fields (CNV-OP); (3) organic management in plastic tunnel fields (ORG-GR); and (4) conventional management in plastic tunnel fields (CNV-GR). Soils obtained at the 0- to 10-cm depth were analyzed using an approach combining traditional soil analysis, microbiological analysis using enzymology and microcalorimetric techniques, and a written survey of management practices among the farmers. Results and discussion Organic management resulted in significant increases (p {$<$} 0.001) in total organic C and total N, Olsen-P, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil respiration, microbial biomass C (C min) and N (N min), and alkaline phosphatase and urease activity. Sucrase activity was highest in CNV-GR soil and lowest in ORG-OP and CNV-OP soils. No significant difference was observed between ORG-OP and CNV-OP. The Olsen-P, total organic C, total N, CEC, N min, and sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities were greater in greenhouse soils than those under open field cultivation, which indicated a higher level of soil management under greenhouse conditions. The microcalorimetry power–time curves for all samples described typical microbial metabolic activity. In soil samples supplemented with glucose and ammonium sulfate, the heat dissipation per cell unit suggested that microorganisms in soils under organic management had more efficient metabolism. In addition, microbial growth in soils under conventional management displayed lower growth rates, lower peak heat, and longer peak heat times, all of which indicated lower activity of soil microorganisms compared with organic management. There was a large positive correlation (p {$<$} 0.01) between the values of P max (the peak value of thermal power), Q total (total heat flux), and k (microbial growth rate constant) and the chemical properties. However, there was a significant negative correlation (p {$<$} 0.05) between the value of t max (the time required to reach peak thermal power) and chemical properties other than sucrase activity. Conclusions Organic production systems significantly improved soil microbial characteristics and increased soil organic C, thus improving soil quality and fertility. Further studies investigating the long-term functional significance of carbon sequestration under organic practices are therefore warranted.},

The organic carbon (OC) content of the grassland plot was 1.8 times greater than that of the similarly fertilized Ca(NO3)2 treated cropped plots. The comparison of two dispersion techniques (a low-energy sonication and a chemical dispersion which yield inherent soil aggregates) showed that increasing OC contents of the silt-sized fractions were not matched by a linear increase of silt-sized aggregates. This indicated saturation of the aggregates with OC and a limited capacity of particles to protect OC physically. Thermogravimetric analyses suggested an increase of free organic matter with increasing OC contents. Transmission FT-IR spectroscopy showed relative enrichment of carboxylic, aromatic, CH and NH groups in plots with increasing OC contents. The silt-sized fractions contained the largest SOM pool and, as revealed by 13C NMR spectroscopy, were qualitatively more influenced by the plant residue versus manure input than the clay fractions. Alkyl and O-alkyl C in the silt-sized fractions amounted to 57.4\% of organic carbon in the animal manure treated plots and 50–53\% in the other treatments.},

  abstract = {Plastic biodegradable mulch (plastic BDM) is tilled after use, but there is concern about incomplete degradation and potential impact on subsequent crops, and we lack a reliable method to measure mulch degradation post soil-incorporation. We conducted two field experiments to (i) develop a sampling method to estimate the amount of mulch (fragments size {$>$}2.36~mm) in the field post soil-incorporation, and (ii) assess the amount of BDM in the soil after four consecutive years of mulch incorporation. In Expt. 1, we used the quartering method to reduce soil from a 1 m2 field sample area to a representative 19~L sample. In Expt. 2, we applied and tilled four plastic BDMs: BioAgri, Naturecycle, Organix AG, and an experimental mulch; and one paper mulch, WeedGuardPlus, in their respective plots for four consecutive years. Starting in year 2, we sampled soil with the quartering method each spring and fall to determine mulch recovery. With respect to the total amount of mulch applied, average mulch recovery in the fall for the three commercial plastic BDMs was 71\%, 50\%, and 35\% after second, third and fourth applications, respectively. For the experimental mulch, the average recovery was 80\%, 69\%, and 54\% in the fall after second, third, and fourth applications, respectively. Recovery was slightly lower in spring than in preceding fall all years. For WeedGuardPlus, average recovery was 14\%–20\% in each fall, and no recovery in any spring (complete degradation). The results show that the quartering method reliably estimates the amount of mulch in a field and BDMs degrade over time in the field even with repeated applications, but complete degradation takes {$>$}1~year. While a few standards (e.g., ASTM D5988) specify how to determine biodegradation of plastics in soil under controlled laboratory conditions, our sampling method assesses plastic degradation under diverse field conditions.},

Four field experiments were set up in the state of São Paulo, Brazil (districts of Mogi das Cruzes, Jarinú, Piracicaba and Itatiba), in the years 2000 and 2001, to evaluate the effects of soil solarization on physical, chemical and biological soil properties. Solarization caused a significant reduction in penetration resistance of the evaluated soils in Jarinu, Piracicaba, and Itatiba. In Jarinu, measurements carried out eight months after the removal of the plastic sheet showed that the effect of solarization on penetration resistance was still similar to that observed in the first evaluation. However, in Mogi das Cruzes, in an organic soil, solarization increased the soil's penetration resistance in the 2.5-5.0 cm layer. Solarization did not affect the macro-, micro- and total porosity of soils in Piracicaba and Jarinu, where these properties were measured, however it did reduce the apparent density. In an evaluation by fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, the microbial activity in the soil proved to decrease by solarization. In Mogi das Cruzes, the suppressiveness to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli was evaluated in vitro by colonizing soil samples with an isolate marked with benomyl resistance. Solarization reduced the recovery of the pathogen, indicating an increase in suppressiveness. In solarized plots, there was a significant increase in the concentration of NH4+-N in all experiments, of Mn in three, of NO3--N, Mg2+, and base saturation in two, and K+ in one experiment. On the other hand, the concentration of Cu, Fe, and H + Al decreased in two places, and Zn in one. Results showed that solarization caused changes in physical, chemical and biological soil properties, improving the soil structure, releasing nutrients, and increasing disease suppressiveness.},

  abstract = {Mankind's present rate of energy consumption is about 10 TW (or about 25\% of the energy used in photosynthesis). It is about a factor of 18 more than that of advanced agricultural man and 300 more than that of hunting man. It has been estimated that a 5–10-fold increase in economic activity is required over the next 50 years to meet the needs of an increased world population as well as to begin to reduce mass poverty. Assuming that this increase in economic activity implies a corresponding increase in energy consumption, it is considered to be impossible without catastrophic environmental consequences. Mankind is now the principal geochemical agent on the planet. It follows that environmental problems are on a global scale. Each of the principal components on which mankind depends, air, water and soil, is vulnerable to degradation and pollution. This leads to the need for a reassessment of all our resources. For instance, consumption of all known fossil fuel reserves would lead to an atmospheric CO2 content of about 1900 ppm. Such a level is clearly unacceptable and this demands a revision of the earth's energy reserves. Sustainable development has come to be accepted as a key goal in environmental policy. Based on mankind's present and projected energy budget, it is seen that sustainable development is not occurring now and will be impossible within the next 50 years. Calculations suggest that a world population of one billion with reasonable living standards is sustainable into the indefinite future. This can be achieved by ensuring one child families for about 100 years. If the present population and economic trends continue, ecological catastrophe is likely to occur in many countries over the next few decades as ecosystems become more degraded and more marginal for human existence. These findings suggest that our whole ideas on population increase and resource consumption require urgent revision.},

Multiple methods have been developed for extracting microplastics from sediment, mainly through density separation. However, the chemicals applied are often expensive and harmful for the user or to the environment. We briefly review the problems associated with the use of these chemicals and present a new floatation solution, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) that has many advantages over available media. It is non-toxic and cheap, and with a density of 1.54 g/cm3 the K2CO3 solution yielded a mean recovery rate of around 92\% for PVC, one of the densest polymers, that cannot be easily extracted with alternative floatation agents. We propose that the use of K2CO3 is particularly promising for long term and large-scale monitoring studies, not least because it allows an increasing involvement of citizen scientists, hopefully leading to an increased public awareness of the plastic problem in the seas.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Commercial farmers have been using polyethylene plastic mulch since the 1950s. Despite the affordability and effectiveness of polyethylene mulch, the disposal process is financially and environmentally costly. Biodegradable plastic mulches, an ecologically sustainable alternative to polyethylene mulch films, were introduced in the 1980s. Biodegradable plastic mulches can be tilled into the soil or composted at the end of the season, reducing the labor and environmental costs associated with plastic removal and disposal. However, research results are mixed as to the effectiveness, degradability and ease-of-use of biodegradable plastic mulches. In 2008–2012, researchers, funded by a USDA Specialty Crop Research Initiative grant, conducted surveys and focus groups in three different agricultural regions of the USA to better understand the barriers and bridges to the adoption of biodegradable plastic mulches for specialty crop production systems. Data on the experiences and views of specialty crop growers, agricultural extension agents, agricultural input suppliers, mulch manufacturers and other stakeholders showed that the major adoption barriers were insufficient knowledge, high cost and unpredictable breakdown. The major bridges to adoption were reduced waste, environmental benefits and interest in further learning. These findings are discussed with reference to the classic innovation diffusion model, specifically work on the innovation–decision process and the attributes of innovations. The study results can be used to guide the activities of those involved in the design, development and promotion of biodegradable plastic mulches for US specialty crop production systems.},

  abstract = {Biodegradable plastics have been introduced and widely used as a promising alternative to traditional nondegradable plastics. However, the differences in sorption behavior of pesticides on nondegradable and biodegradable microplastics has been insufficiently studied. Here, four types of nondegradable [polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP)] and two types of biodegradable [polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene succinate (PBS)] microplastics were selected to investigate the sorption mechanism of fipronil based on their sorption kinetics and isotherms. The results indicated that the sorption rates of PLA and PBS were much higher than those of PE, PP, PVC and PS and that the sorption capacities of fipronil on microplastics followed the order of PBS {$>$} PLA {$>$} PP {$>$} PE {$>$} PS {$>$} PVC. The sorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R2 = 0.953–0.998) for all tested microplastics. External mass transport and intraparticle diffusion were the main rate controlling steps of the sorption of fipronil on microplastics. Furthermore, isotherm results indicated that a Langmuir model provided the best fit for fipronil sorption on PE, PS, PVC and PP (R2 = 0.997–0.999), while a Freundlich model was the most appropriate model for PLA and PBS (R2 = 0.998–0.999). The presence of surface O-containing functional groups and the spatial arrangement of rubbery domains are likely to affect the sorption process. The results from this work suggest that microplastics, especially biodegradable ones, may play an important role in the fate and transport of pesticides, and their effects on soil organisms (e.g., earthworms) require further investigation.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Butterhead lettuce was characterized by physical, microbiological and nutritional quality indices as a function of plant zoning and soil management (bare soil and mulch). Quality indices were measured in all the rings from the external toward the internal ratio. Assayed indices were: relative water content, water content, free and bound water, and the ratio between free water and total water, leaf area and color, total microbial counts (TMC) and ascorbic acid content (AA). The lettuce characterization by rings showed a remarkable plant zoning as a function of leaf age and development; also, some initial indices were affected by the soil management employed. Plastic mulches affect the microclimate around the plant, resulting in better plant water status. However, the use of black plastic covers could absorb sunlight therefore increasing soil temperature and causing lower AA and higher TMC in lettuce tissue. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS During lettuce development, each leaf had a different level of exposure to environmental conditions, such as light, humidity, nutrients absorption and temperature affecting the quality indices of the raw material and introducing a source of variability in the physico-chemical, biochemical, nutritional and microbiological indices within the plant. In this way, the location of the leaf within the whole plant is an important factor to be considered. Moreover, during lettuce heads trading, it is a common practice to remove the external leaves as storage advances. These leaves are more perishable than middle and internal ones because of their direct exposure to environmental conditions. Understanding the way in which physical, microbiological and nutritional indices were distributed in the whole lettuce plant could be of interest, to know the value of the losses of regular green grocers' practices, from a nutritional and a safety point of view.},

Their suitability as matrices for obtaining sustainable eco-composites reinforced with industrially-sourced residual natural fibers was investigated in order to boost their recovery and prevent waste generation. The analysis of the studied residual agricultural plastics revealed that they are low density polyethylene still containing significant amounts of ethylene-vinyl acetate (2.5–4.5~wt\%). A pilot–plant extrusion-compounding technology was applied to a selected recycled plastic from residual agricultural films and the residual cellulose fibers for obtaining the eco-composites. The effects of cellulose-fiber content and a selected maleic anhydride-modified polyethylene coupling agent on the properties and interfacial adhesion of the eco-composites were investigated. By using micromechanical models, scientific data of the intrinsic modulus and strength of the Eucalyptus Globulus residual fibers, hitherto scarcely available in literature, were found to be 16.4~GPa and 180~MPa, respectively, thus revealing their suitability as cost-effective reinforcement. Tensile modulus and strength of the eco-composites were up to 667\% and 70\% greater than those of the neat agricultural recycled plastic, the latter due to the enhanced compatibility provided by the ethylene-vinyl acetate found. When the coupling agent was added, tensile and flexural strengths increased up to a maximum of 20.26~MPa and 23.96~MPa, respectively. Property variations were found to be due to the fiber length reduction and the interfacial adhesion improvement caused by the coupling agent as well as to its plasticizing effect. The properties achieved revealed the suitability of the eco-composites for their immediate application in the production of numerous environmentally sustainable and cost-effective end-products from the aforementioned wastes.},

Treatments consisted of five mulch colors: black, white, red, silver, and blue installed either with or without spun-bonded row cover. Soil temperatures were 4 to 7 °C lower than air temperatures in all treatments. The use of darker (black, blue, red) -colored plastic mulches increased early and total yield of okra compared with bare soil with and without row cover. Increased soil and air temperatures did not always correlate to an increase in yield. It can be concluded that the use of dark plastic mulch is advantageous to growers of okra in climates that do not have cool springs, but the added use of row covers to plastic mulch has no effect on growth and yield. The profit of marketable okra produced using a row cover was \$1.37 versus \$1.35 per pound without a cover in 2003 and \$1.28 versus \$1.29 per pound in 2004. Blue plastic mulch is ≈\$0.08 per foot more expensive than black plastic.

Mulch color and year significantly affected air and soil temperatures and row cover significantly affected air temperature. Soil temperatures were more than 5°C lower than air temperatures in all treatments and air temperatures were 2–5°C higher with row covers than without. Increased soil and air temperatures did not always result in yield increases. Colored plastic mulch with or without row covers did not increase early fruit yield in squash. Lack of a mulch/row cover induced temperature effect on yield was attributed to the relatively high mean air temperatures that may have masked treatment temperature effects.}

To evaluate this system, a two-year field study was conducted to determine the effect of the RFRRH system with impermeable and permeable polyethylene (PE) mulch on soil water content, crop yield and production cost effectiveness in purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea Moench.) production. The results of the study in 2007 and 2008 showed that the RFRRH system with impermeable and permeable PE mulch increases soil water content in dry periods at the beginning of plant growth, which can be one of the main reasons for higher yields in the mulch-covered RFRRH system in comparison to the control (uncovered ridges). Moreover, higher yield and a reduction of labour improved production cost effectiveness in the RFRRH system with mulches in comparison to the control. The results confirm that the RFRRH system with mulches, in view of its rainwater-collecting efficiency, simplicity and economic potential, can be applied in agricultural production.

One aspect is the influence that microplastic may have on enhancing the transport and bioavailability of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances (PBT). In this study we assess these potential risks using a thermodynamic approach, aiming to prioritize the physicochemical properties of chemicals that are most likely absorbed by microplastic and therefore ingested by biota. Using a multimedia modeling approach, we define a chemical space aimed at improving our understanding of how chemicals partition in the marine environment with varying volume ratios of air/water/organic carbon/polyethylene, where polyethylene represents a main group of microplastic. Results suggest that chemicals with log KOW {$>$} 5 have the potential to partition {$>$}1\% to polyethylene. Food-web model results suggest that reductions in body burden concentrations for nonpolar organic chemicals are likely to occur for chemicals with log KOW between 5.5 and 6.5. Thus the relative importance of microplastic as a vector of PBT substances to biological organisms is likely of limited importance, relative to other exposure pathways. Nevertheless, a number of data-gaps are identified, largely associated with improving our understanding of the physical fate of microplastic in the environment.},

The study covers part of the Southern Baltic’s drainage area. Apart from styrofoam and beach sand, the research involved mosses, which are bioindicators of atmospheric metal pollution. The research has shown that mercury present in the environment becomes associated with styrofoam debris. The median for mercury concentrations in virgin styrofoam samples (0.23 ng g−1 dry weight (d.w.)) and in beach sand samples (0.69 ng g−1 d.w.) was an order of magnitude lower than in the styrofoam debris (5.20 ng g−1 d.w.). The highest mercury content observed in styrofoam debris (3,863 ng g−1 d.w.) exceeded the standards for bottom sediment and soil. The binding of mercury to styrofoam debris takes place in water, and presumably also through contact with the ground. A significant role in this process was played by biotic factors, such as the presence of biofilm and abiotic ones, such as solar radiation and the transformations of mercury forms related to it. As a result, mercury content in styrofoam debris underwent seasonal changes, peaking in summertime. Furthermore, the regional changes of mercury content in the studied debris seem to reflect the pollution levels of the environment.},

  abstract = {A model that predicts radiation transfer through single and double layers of plastic covering over kohlrabi canopies is developed, parameterised and tested. This model will be the foundation of an energy balance and growth module for covered kohlrabi crops that can be used in cover management. Radiation transfer through covers is based on their laboratory-measured angular-resolved transmittances, which are upscaled to non-plane covers in the field. The upscaling procedure accounts for distributed facet slopes according to the Beckmann distribution and visibility, as well as interception preference according to the cosine of the facet-ray incidence angle. Additional measured and upscaled quantities include absorptance and the degree of haze at several angles. The effects of plastic ageing and wetting are measured and implemented into the model using simple empirical approaches. Radiation transfer through the canopy is described by a thoroughly tested 1D canopy model, which accounts effectively for multiple reflections between leaves and the soil. A reanalysis of combined gap fraction and leaf area data from a previous study revealed a tendency of kohlrabi canopies to overdisperse at early growth stages, when only minor leaf area overlapping occurs. Using hourly measurements of photosynthetic active radiation flux densities at the soil level over two growth seasons at one site, the overall model performed reasonably well for a non-woven fabric-based cover (n = 1067, R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 6.62 W m−2) and a combination of a low-density polyethylene perforated plastic on top of a non-woven fabric (n = 1112, R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 5.11 W m−2). Simulations showed rather low degree of model sensitivity to the specification of cover roughness, but a high level of sensitivity to a proper parameterisation of angular optical properties of covers and of canopy radiation transfer in the NIR spectral range.},

Previous approaches are modified and extended to include: (1) the circumsolar part of diffuse radiation; and (2) the altered interception of diffuse short- and long-wave radiation due to horizon obstructions and surface slope. A simple solution was found for the interception problem under an uniform radiating sky, and an extensive numerical simulation study with broadly varying sky conditions and surface geometries revealed an error of about 10\% using this approximation. Similarly simulations for long-wave sky radiation interception highlighted the good predictive quality of the uniform sky solution with errors of about 1\%. Additionally, a thorough derivation of directional responses of transmissivity and reflectivity of different commonly used plastics is provided. Oblique direct radiation incidence angles due to ridged surfaces were taken into account using a Fresnel theory based approach adapted from window design research and extended to describe the effect of a liquid water film on the inside of the plastic. The validity of this proposed model to accurately predict the temperature dynamics for a two-dimensional ridge surface partly covered by a plastic mulch is presented in an accompanying paper.

  abstract = {This work presents the calibration and validation procedure of a simulation model to predict the temperature dynamics for soil ridges partly covered by a plastic mulch. To this end, soil temperatures were measured hourly over 3 months at two sites for six different plastic-mulch treatments. For calibration, only three parameters had to be estimated from data taken over one month at one site. Overall, simulated data fitted with the whole data set on soil temperatures, with root mean square errors of 1·5 and 1·9 K for both sites, respectively; thus confirming the validity of this approach. Test simulations established that for opaque plastics, detailed analysis of directional radiative properties is not necessary, and for transparent plastics, rather simpler approaches, such as the Schlick equation, are sufficient. Small-scale advection effects along single ridges were evident, and hourly deviations contributing to this effect reached up to 3 K. Only a few inputs have to be provided to apply the model: the soil humus content and texture, the shape of the ridge, and the transmissivities and reflectivities of the used plastic mulches. The presented model can be applied for optimisations regarding (1) the timing of ridging and covering, (2) the dimensions and orientations of ridges, and (3) the radiative properties of plastic mulches.},

  abstract = {Polyolefins are subject to chemical changes when they are brought in contact with the environment. In the presence of UV-radiation and oxygen, photo-oxidation causes chain scission and cross-linking in polyethylene and polypropylene. This review provides a detailed presentation of the reactions that take place and their effects on the properties of polymers. In this review, radical formation and Norrish reactions are discussed in depth, along with the formation of peroxides and carbonyl compounds. More than a dozen different types of carbonyl compounds can be observed by FTIR. While Norrish reactions are the main reason for chain scission and molecular weight reduction, the initial step of the photo-oxidation may be related to the formation of O2-polymer charge transfer complexes. Photo-oxidation takes place mainly in the amorphous region of the polymer, and polymers with a high tertiary-carbon content are more affected than those with straight chains. Chain scission occurs only in the presence of oxygen, whereas cross-linking in the absence of oxygen results in gel formation. Weathering conditions include seasonal changes, and the day-and-night cycle has a strong impact on photo-oxidation. The chemical changes occurring during weathering influence crystallinity and the mechanical properties of polyolefins. Most of the fundamental work in this field was published more than 30 years ago. It is necessary for the results of these early studies to be verified by methodologies developed in recent years.},

In response, we developed a method that extracts plastics magnetically, taking advantage of their hydrophobic surface to magnetize the plastics. We created hydrophobic Fe nanoparticles that bind to plastic, allowing magnetic recovery. With this principle applied to a simple method, we recovered 92\% of 10–20 μm polyethylene and polystyrene beads and 93\% of {$>$}1 mm MPs (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene) from seawater. We also recovered 84\% and 78\% of MPs (polyethylene, polystyrene, polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene) ranging~from 200 μm to 1 mm from freshwater and sediments, respectively. Overall, the procedure is efficient for various sizes, polymer types, and sample matrices and can be considered by researchers to be included as a step of the extraction procedure for MPs (i.e., post~density separation) or stand-alone for cleaner samples (i.e., drinking water).},

Aluminum foil and aluminum-painted mulches are effective at repelling insect pests, especially aphids (Aphididae) and thrips (Thripidae). Yields are often higher with black plastic compared to bare ground. Clear plastic is rarely used in the U.S. because it can encourage weed growth, unless a herbicide or fumigant is used underneath. Colored mulches can increase yields and control pests, but color may be less important than brightness of the mulch or contrast with bare soil. New forms of photodegradable mulches eliminate the need to remove and dispose of plastic at the end of the growing season, but have not been widely adapted because they tend to degrade prematurely.},

Soil quality can be assessed using a minimum data set comprising soil attributes such as texture, organic matter, pH, bulk density, and rooting depth. Soil organic matter has particular significance for soil quality as it can influence many different soil properties including other attributes of the minimum data set. Assessment of soil organic matter is a valuable step towards identifying the overall quality of a soil and may be so informative as to be included in minimum data sets used to evaluate the world’s soils.In this review, soil organic matter is considered to encompass a set of attributes rather than being a single entity. Included among the attributes and discussed here are total soil organic carbon and nitrogen, light fraction and macroorganic (particulate) matter, mineralizable carbon and nitrogen, microbial biomass, soil carbohydrates and enzymes. These attributes are involved in various soil processes, such as those related to nutrient storage, biological activity, and soil structure, and can be used to establish different minimum data sets for the evaluation of soil organic matter quality.

Analytical chemical analysis was used for quantification. In field studies, halosulfuron, paraquat, carfentrazone, glyphosate, and flumioxazin were surface applied to black 32μm-thick (1.25 mil) LDPE mulch. LDPE mulch harvest began 1 h after treatment (HAT) then continued every 24 h for five consecutive rainfree days after treatment (DAT) to determine the level of herbicide dissipation from the LDPE mulch surface. In a related study, treated LDPE mulch was harvested 1 HAT, then sprinkler irrigation was applied, followed by a sampling five HAT, then the same irrigation and sampling procedure was repeated every 24 h for five consecutive DAT. The order for half-life, as defined as time for 50\% dissipation (DT50), varied by herbicide and method of dissipation for dry and irrigated studies.Data indicated that glyphosate and paraquat dissipation was rapid following irrigation. Glyphosate and paraquat DT 50 were both 1 h in the irrigated study, but 84 and 32 h for the dry scenario, respectively. This indicated that glyphosate and paraquat could be removed from LDPE mulch with rainfall or irrigation, primarily due to their high water solubility.Halosulfuron and flumioxazin DT 50 were 3 and 6 h in the irrigated study, and 18 and 57 h for the dry study, respectively.Carfentrazone DT 50 was similar at 28 and 30 h for the irrigated and dry studies, respectively. This indicated that carfentrazone was adsorbed to the LDPE mulch, and irrigation water did not remove it from the LDPE mulch. Results from !

  abstract = {The aim was to investigate whether soils developed under tropical conditions had different organic matter and microbial biomass dynamics than soils developed under temperate ones. Three soils formed under temperate climatic conditions (U.K.) and three under tropical conditions (Brazilian) were selected to be as comparable as possible in terms of organic matter, clay content and pH. They were then incubated moist at 15°C or 35°C for 150 d. Carbon dioxide evolution and microbial biomass were measured at intervals during the incubation. The biomasses in the tropical soils declined more slowly at both temperatures than in the temperate soils, although at 15°C the differences were mainly small. At 35°C the decline was generally much more marked in the temperate soils (60–75\% of the initial value) than in the tropical ones (15, 40 and 60\%). Soil organic matter was mineralised more rapidly in the temperate than the tropical soils: at 35°C up to 9–10 times more CO2–C was evolved than was contained in the temperate biomasses during the 150 d incubation. The comparable maximum value for the tropical soils was 4.5 times. These results seem to indicate that the organic matter in the tropical soils was more degraded, or humified, than that in the temperate soils. An attempt to quantify the extent of humification was made using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Both methods also indicated that the organic matter was generally more humified in the tropical than temperate soils. It was concluded that DTA and TG may both be useful techniques in studying soil organic matter dynamics, especially when linked to studies of soil microbial dynamics.},

However, pyrolysis generates large numbers of compounds in varying concentrations, factors that can make compound identification and quantitation difficult. In this study, Miscanthus biomass samples were analyzed using pyrolysis/two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GCxGC-MS), which provided a more comprehensive chromatographic separation and mass spectral compound identification. Quantitative measurement was performed for 34 calibrated pyrolysis compounds using an internal standard method. Pyrolysis efficiency was measured as a function of sample mass, pyrolysis temperature, and pyrolysis temperature ramp rate. For most of the calibrated pyrolysis products, production efficiency decreased with sample mass, increased with pyrolysis temperature, and decreased with pyrolysis temperature ramp rate. Significantly, the temperature profiles of the different pyrolysis products were variable, notably acetic acid and the vinyl and formyl derivatives of phenol and guaiacol, which were produced at lower temperatures compared to other compounds such as the syringyl derivatives and levoglucosan. Lignol ratios were compared with those generated using 1H/13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Lower fractions of syringyl- and guaiacyl-lignols and higher fractions of the phenol-lignols were generated by Py-GCxGC-MS compared to HSQC-NMR.},

  abstract = {A systematic investigation of the transport behavior of in situ mobilized soil colloidal particles in their parent soil matrix medium is presented. Particle advection, dispersion, and deposition kinetics were studied by analysis of particle breakthrough curves as a response to short-pulse particle injections to the inlet of packed soil columns. The transport of the heterogeneous soil particles was compared to the transport of monodisperse carboxyl latex particles to further understand the various particle transport mechanisms. Results show that colloidal particles travel much faster than a conservative tracer (nitrate) due to size exclusion effects, whereby mobile colloidal particles are excluded from small pores within the soil medium. Dispersivity of the natural and latex particles was compared to that of the conservative tracer, and the results indicate that particle dispersivity is greater than the tracer dispersivity. Dispersivity of colloidal particles was shown to be essentially independent of pore water velocity, whereas tracer dispersivity increased with increasing pore water velocity due to a combination of convective and diffusive transport of tracer molecules in small pores within the soil aggregates. The effect of divalent counterions on particle deposition kinetics was also investigated by comparing the results to deposition kinetics with monovalent counterions. Particle deposition rate with Ca2+ was shown to be higher than with Na+, and the critical deposition concentrations with Na+ were greater than those with Ca2+. In contrast to the marked effect of ionic strength and divalent cations, changes in proton activity over more than 1 order of magnitude (from pH 4.0 to 5.5) did not have a significant effect on particle deposition kinetics. Quantitative analysis of the observed particle transport results demonstrates that the transport of the natural colloidal particles in the packed soil columns can be adequately described by the advection-dispersion equation with a first-order, irreversible deposition kinetics term.},

Long-term bare fallows offer a unique opportunity to isolate the stable organic pool of soils and study its properties. We investigated the vulnerability of the stable organic C pool to fresh organic matter inputs by comparing the mineralization in a long-term bare fallow soil with that of an adjacent arable soil, containing stable C as well as more labile C. For this, we amended or not the soil samples with two different 13C-labelled fresh organic matter (straw or cellulose). In all cases we found a positive priming effect (i.e. an increased mineralization of soil organic carbon) when fresh organic matter was added. By comparing the results obtained on both soils, we estimated that half of the “primed” C in the arable soil due to straw addition as fresh organic matter, originated from the stable C pool. Our results suggest that under such conditions, which frequently occur, the stable pool of soil organic matter may largely contribute to soil extra-CO2 emissions due to priming effect. Consequently, the C storage potential of this pool may be modified by changes in land use and/or biomass production that might change the priming of the mineralization of the stable pool of soil organic carbon.},

For wastewaters from polyester-cotton blends, the chemical nature of the fiber debris (natural vs. synthetic origin) was determined by combining the dynamic image analysis with a chemical pre-treatment.

Two mulches were prepared from polylactic acid (PLA) using spunbond processing, one naturally white and the other black (SB-W and SB-B, respectively), and two via meltblown processing, from 100 \% PLA and a 75/25 w/w blend of PLA and polyhydroxyalkanoate [PHA; poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate); MB-PLA and MB-PLA+PHA, respectively]. SB-W and SB-B possessed higher tensile strength than MB-PLA and MB-PLA+PHA (56.2N, 37.1N, 8.96N, and 3.90N, respectively). Simulated weathering introduced minor changes in physicochemical properties of SBs, but enhanced inherent biodegradability, yielding 68–72 \% mineralization in 90 days. Simulated weathering greatly affected the physicochemical properties of the MB mulches, particularly MB-PLA+PHA, which underwent a 95 \% loss of tensile strength, 32 \% decrease of weight-averaged molecular weight (from 95.4 to 70.5 kDa), and breakage of microfibers, during a 21 days weatherometry cycle. Weathering accelerated the biodegradation of both MB mulches, with the time course of biodegradation and final extent of biodegradation (91–93 \% in 90 days) nearly matching the value obtained for the cellulosic positive control. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested the SB and MB mulches underwent hydrolysis and photodegradative chain scission (Norrish Type II reaction). SB nonwovens may prove useful as biobased and compostable materials for multi-season mulching, and other long-term agricultural applications, such as for row covers in perennial cropping systems. MB nonwovens may be better suited for more traditional agricultural mulch applications.},

  abstract = {Over the last 60 years plastics production has increased manifold, owing to their inexpensive, multipurpose, durable and lightweight nature. These characteristics have raised the demand for plastic materials that will continue to grow over the coming years. However, with increased plastic materials production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste management industry. The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in literature and described herein. These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates. Thus, sound recycling has to be performed in such a way as to ensure that emission of substances of high concern and contamination of recycled products is avoided, ensuring environmental and human health protection, at all times.},

  abstract = {A low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film containing a hindered amine light stabiliser (Chimassorb 944) was exposed to a composting mixture, chemical hydrolysis at pH 5 and pH 7 and air, in all cases at room temperature and for a period of 4 years. The structural changes of the LDPE film were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and size exclusion chromatography with viscosity detection (SEC-viscosity) while degradation products of LDPE and Chimassorb 944 were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Determination of the amount of remaining stabiliser was performed using an ultrasonic extraction technique followed by UV spectroscopy analysis (250 nm, absorption of 1,3,5-triazine group). The ultrasonic extraction of Chimassorb 944 was carried out at 60°C for a period of 1 h, using chloroform as extracting solvent. Loss of the stabiliser accompanied by structural changes of the polymeric matrix occurred during exposition time and was strongly influenced by exposure conditions. Thus, the fastest loss of the stabiliser was found on exposition to chemical hydrolysis at both pH while the slowest loss was observed during ageing in compost. Different products formed from Chimassorb 944 were found in all the tested environments as a result both of degradation of the stabiliser to smaller fragments and of reactions between these fragments and other additives present in LDPE. Thus, (Z)-9-octadecenamide was found in both unexposed and all the tested samples and was formed already during processing. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidine was found in air and compost aged samples while 2,4-di-t-butyl-6-nitro-phenol was found in the samples exposed to air and water environments and [2-cyclohexene-1-dione, 3,5-dimethyl, O-methyloxime] were found exclusively in the samples aged in water at pH 5.},

  abstract = {We are living in a plastic age. For most of us, life without polymers and plastics is unthinkable. However, in recent years the littering of plastics and the problems related to their persistence in the environment have become a major focus in both research and the news. Biodegradable polymers like poly(lactic acid) are seen as a suitable alternative to commodity plastics in order to minimize the impact of plastics on the environment after disposal. However, poly(lactic acid) is basically non-degradable in seawater. Similarly, the degradation rate of other biodegradable polymers also crucially depends on the environments they end up in, such as soil or marine water, or when used in biomedical devices. In this review, we show that biodegradation tests carried out in artificial environments lack transferability to real conditions and, therefore, highlight the necessity of environmentally authentic and relevant field-testing conditions. In addition, we focus on ecotoxicological implications of biodegradable polymers: Are there any possible adverse effects on biota caused by degradation products of the polymers? We also consider the social aspects and ask how biodegradable polymers influence consumer behavior and municipal waste management. Taken together, this study is intended as a contribution towards evaluating the potential of biodegradable polymers as alternative materials to commodity plastics.},

Most obviously, ecosystems can provide us with material things that are essential for our daily lives, such as food, wood, wool and medicines. Although the other types of benefit we get from ecosystems are easily overlooked, they also play an important role in regulating the environments in which we live. They can help ensure the flow of clean water and protect us from flooding or other hazards like soil erosion, land-slips and tsunamis. They can contribute to our spiritual well-being, through their cultural or religious significance or the opportunities they provide for recreation and the enjoyment of nature.In this chapter, we will look at the goods and services that ecosystems can provide and the role that biodiversity may play in producing them, specifically the contribution that biodiversity makes to people's livelihoods, to their security and to their health. In other words, we will concentrate mainly on the utilitarian value of biodiversity. We will also explore how these ideas link up with those of the Ecosystem Approach to environmental management and policy, and some of the implications of this for how sustainable development is defined.},

Soil MPs abundance in grassland and farmland was positively correlated with precipitation and 0~cm ground temperature; and negatively correlated with average wind speed (p~{$<~$}0.05). Both the particle size of {$<~$}1~mm and pellet-shape MPs abundance showed a positive correlation with SOC (p~{$<~$}0.05).

  abstract = {Approaches for the collection and analysis of plastic debris in environmental matrices are rapidly evolving. Such plastics span a continuum of sizes, encompassing large (macro-), medium (micro-, typically defined as particles between 1 μm and 5 mm), and smaller (nano-) plastics. All are of environmental relevance. Particle sizes are dynamic. Large plastics may fragment over time, while smaller particles may agglomerate in the field. The diverse morphologies (fragment, fiber, sphere) and chemical compositions of microplastics further complicate their characterization. Fibers are of growing interest and present particular analytical challenges due to their narrow profiles. Compositional classes of emerging concern include tire wear, paint chips, semisynthetics (e.g., rayon), and bioplastics. Plastics commonly contain chemical additives and fillers, which may alter their toxicological potency, behavior (e.g., buoyancy), or detector response (e.g., yield fluorescence) during analysis. Field sampling methods often focus on {$>$}20 μm and even {$>$}300 μm sized particles and will thus not capture smaller microplastics (which may be most abundant and bioavailable). Analysis of a limited subgroup (selected polymer types, particle sizes, or shapes) of microplastics, while often operationally necessary, can result in an underestimation of actual sample content. These shortcomings complicate calls for toxicological studies of microplastics to be based on “environmentally relevant concentrations.” Sample matrices of interest include water (including wastewater, ice, snow), sediment (soil, dust, wastewater sludge), air, and biota. Properties of the environment, and of the particles themselves, may concentrate plastic debris in select zones (e.g., gyres, shorelines, polar ice, wastewater sludge). Sampling designs should consider such patchy distributions. Episodic releases due to weather and anthropogenic discharges should also be considered. While water grab samples and sieving are commonplace, novel techniques for microplastic isolation, such as continuous flow centrifugation, show promise. The abundance of nonplastic particulates (e.g., clay, detritus, biological material) in samples interferes with microplastic detection and characterization. Their removal is typically accomplished using a combination of gravity separation and oxidative digestion (including strong bases, peroxide, enzymes); unfortunately, aggressive treatments may damage more labile plastics. Microscope-based infrared or Raman detection is often applied to provide polymer chemistry and morphological data for individual microplastic particles. However, the sheer number of particles in many samples presents logistical hurdles. In response, instruments have been developed that employ detector arrays and rapid scanning lasers. The addition of dyes to stain particulates may facilitate spectroscopic detection of some polymer types. Most researchers provide microplastic data in the form of the abundances of polymer types within particle size, polymer, and morphology classes. Polymer mass data in samples remain rare but are essential to elucidating fate. Rather than characterizing individual particles in samples, solvent extraction (following initial sample prep, such as sediment size class sorting), combined with techniques such as thermoanalysis (e.g., pyrolysis), has been used to generate microplastic mass data. However, this may obviate the acquisition of individual particle morphology and compositional information. Alternatively, some techniques (e.g., electron and atomic force microscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry) are adept at providing highly detailed data on the size, morphology, composition, and surface chemistry of select particles. Ultimately, the analyst must select the approach best suited for their study goals. Robust quality control elements are also critical to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the sampling and analysis techniques. Further, improved efforts are required to assess and control possible sample contamination due to the ubiquitous distribution of microplastics, especially in indoor environments where samples are processed.},

  abstract = {A numerical model was developed to simulate the effect of plastic mulches on the field energy balance and soil temperature regime. Newton-Raphson methods were used to solve the energy balances of the soil and mulch simultaneously. The resultant temperature of the soil surface was used as a boundary condition for an implicit finite difference model of soil heat flow. The model contained a detailed radiation section to account for mulch optical properties in shortwave and longwave bands. Heat transfer between the mulch and soil surface was modeled using a thermal contact resistance, and transport in the boundary layer was quantified using flux profile theory. The effect of evaporation and condensation on the underside of the mulch was not considered. The accuracy of the model was verified by comparing simulated soil temperatures with field data collected under five commercially available mulches. Simulated average daily temperatures were within +/- 1.3-degrees-C of the observed values and root mean square errors were less than 2.5-degrees-C in all cases. The model showed that mulch optical properties strongly influenced the way energy was partitioned at the surface. Complete characterization of the mulches in the longwave spectrum was required for realistic simulation. Changing longwave reflectance by only 0.3, for example, caused maximum soil temperature to change by 5-degrees-C under some mulches. Thermal contact resistance between the mulch and soil affected temperatures by up to 20-degrees-C beneath mulches that strongly transmitted or absorbed radiation. However, contact resistance was not an important factor for mulches that had nearly equal shortwave transmittance and absorptance. Results demonstrate that a complex relationship exists between mulch optical properties and thermal contact resistance. Modification of mulch longwave properties during manufacturing and control of thermal contact resistance during mulch installation appear to be two promising areas for research. An alternative numerical scheme was evaluated that utilized linear forms of the energy balance equations. The linearized model produced results almost identical to the original model, but required less computing time and could be adapted easily to simulate multiple mulch layers.},

Optical properties of the mulches were measured in the laboratory in the shortwave (0.3 to 1.1 μm) and longwave (2.5 to 25 μm) wavebands using a spectroradiometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, respectively. Additionally, each mulch was installed on a fine sandy loam soil near Manhattan, Kan. Air and soil temperatures were measured 5 cm above and 10 cm below the surface, respectively. Measurements of longwave radiation emitted and reflected from the surface were used to approximate the apparent temperature of the surface. Shortwave transmittance of the mulches ranged from 0.01 to 0.84, and shortwave reflectance ranged from 0.01 to 0.48, with the greatest reflectance from white and aluminized mulches. Infrared transmittance ranged from 0.87 for a black photodegradable mulch to 0.09 for aluminized material. Air temperatures at 5 cm were similar for all mulch treatments, but were typically 3 to 5C higher than the air at 1.5 m during the day. Midday soil temperatures were highest beneath mulches with high shortwave absorptance (black plastics) or those with high shortwave transmittance coupled with low longwave transmittance. Apparent surface temperatures approached 70 to 80C during midday, with the highest temperatures occurring on mulches with high shortwave absorptance. For some mulches, both, shortwave and longwave optical properties of the plastic governed the level of radiative heating. Our results suggest that conduction of heat between the plastic and the soil surface also affects the extent of soil heating in a mulched field.},

Surface analytical techniques including sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG) revealed short wave UV exposure induced major molecular changes on the plasticized PVC surfaces, resulting in increased surface hydrophilicity and decreased CH3 content with increasing exposure time. Additionally, it was deduced from multiple techniques that the surface and the bulk of the plastic exposed to short wave UV contained phthalic monoesters and phthalic acid formed from multistep radical reactions. In contrast, when exposed to long wave UV, molecular content and ordering on the surfaces of the plastic remained relatively unchanged and the introduction of DEHP in plastic helped protect PVC chains from degradation. Results from this study demonstrate short wave UV exposure will result in plastic surfaces containing phthalates and phthalate-related products accessible to contact by living organisms.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution in the environment has received growing attention worldwide. A major impediment for accurate measurements of microplastics in environmental matrixes is to extract the particles. The most commonly-used method for separation from soil or sediment is flotation in dense liquid based on the relatively low density of plastic particles. This study provides an improved and optimized process for extraction of microplastic particles by modifying the floatation technique and floatation solution. Microplastics in soils and sediments are extracted by adding 200 g dry soil or sediment sample to 1.3 L mix of the saturated NaCl and NaI solutions in a volume ratio of 1:1 and aerating for 40 s then filtering the supernatant. The accuracy and precision of the new approach is validated by recovery experiments using soil and sediment samples spiked with six common microplastic compounds: polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS), and comparison with the previous method. The optimized approach is further compared with the previous approach using the real soil and sediment samples.},

The expected increase in microplastic pollution may elevate the risk posed by these synthetic particles to the health of both the aquatic environment and humans. This review seeks to provide a current overview of the occurrence, fate, and impacts of microplastics in aquatic environments worldwide. We first summarize studies recording the occurrence of representative microplastics in marine and freshwater environments, revealing the sources and composition of microplastics. Then, the sorption behavior and relationship between microplastics and pollutants are discussed. The influence of the weathering/aging process and environmental factors on sorption behavior in laboratory tests and real environments is reviewed with particular emphasis on contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Finally, the potential toxic effects of microplastics on aquatic biota and human health are discussed. This review aims to advance our understanding of the fate and impacts of microplastics in aquatic environments and to shed light on important questions warranting further investigation.},

  abstract = {A lysimeter experiment was conducted to examine the effects of plastic film mulching on the leaching rate of nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) from chemical fertilizer that was applied to an upland field that had been converted from paddy rice production. Leaching was monitored in two lysimeters filled with sandy loam soil, which contained low soil organic matter content, under different surface mulch conditions. One was mulched only on the ridge (ridge-mulch treatment) and another one was mulched fully, including the furrow, with black plastic film (full-mulch treatment). Chemical fertilizer was mixed into the top 0.2 m of soil in the two lysimeters before installing the mulch. After transplanting broccoli, the amount of subsurface discharge water and the NO3-N concentrations in the discharge water were measured every day. Larger NO3-N discharges occurred in the ridge-mulch treatment for three days after heavy rainfalls in which cumulative precipitation exceeded 10 mm, and the daily NO3-N load was twice as large as the full-mulch treatment. The differences in the amount of subsurface discharge water and NO3-N discharged between treatments were not significant when there was no rainfall. Cumulative NO3-N loads for the ridge- and full-mulch treatment during the last month of the experimental period were 0.246 and 0.195 g m−2, respectively. The effect of mulching on the reduction of NO3-N discharge rate was higher for the full-mulch treatment. This result showed that a plastic-film mulching system would be effective as an appropriate fertilizer management to reduce nitrate-leaching losses.},

The method was evaluated on a model sample of mixed microplastics comprised of five major polymers: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polystyrene (PSt), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The representative ions in the mass spectra of the pyrolyzates were identified by Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS measurements of the individual polymer species. The unique APCI ionization/fragmentation process and the high mass resolution of TOFMS were exploited to confirm the presence of the respective polymer species in the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the mixed sample for the selected key ions. PE and PP were successfully and uniquely identified in the mixed sample by focusing on specific fragment ions of the pyrolyzates formed during APCI (m/z 114.093 ± 0.020 and m/z 156.139 ± 0.020, respectively). The resultant EICs allowed for the specific analysis of these species, even in the presence of interfering species produced from the other polymers. Similar processes were applied to the detection of PVC, PSt, and PET in the mixed sample. These results demonstrated that Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS is a promising tool to characterize a complex mixture of environmental microplastics.},

So far, research activities have mainly focused on the occurrence of microplastics (MP) in marine habitats, while little is known about their distribution and composition in the terrestrial environment. Agricultural practices such as fertilization, mulching or ensilage make agriculture a likely path for MP into the environment. Here, we collected soil samples at 15 farmland locations in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany, to study the amount, distribution and composition of MP in the size range between 1 and 5~mm. In total, 379 MP were identified in a total of \textasciitilde 84~kg of dry weight (DW). Particle abundances in the sampling units ranged from 0 to 217.8 MP per kg DW with a mean abundance of 3.7~±~11.9 MP per kg DW (median: 0.0, interquartile range: 0.0–4.9) per site. Although MP were found at all study sites, only 34\% of the sampling units contained synthetic particles. Our data contribute to the establishment of a baseline on the amount, type and size of MP in farmland soils. Such a baseline is important for future monitoring schemes and for the development of more environmentally friendly management systems that reduce the input of MP into the agricultural system.},

While a significant proportion of microplastic pollution is likely sequestered within freshwater environments, these habitats also constitute an important conduit of microscopic polymer particles to oceans worldwide. The quantity of aquatic microplastic waste is predicted to dramatically increase over the next decade, but the fate and biological implications of this pollution are still poorly understood. A growing body of research has aimed to characterize the formation, composition, and spatiotemporal distribution of microplastic-associated (“plastisphere”) microbial biofilms. Plastisphere microorganisms have been suggested to play significant roles in pathogen transfer, modulation of particle buoyancy, and biodegradation of plastic polymers and co-contaminants, yet investigation of these topics within freshwater environments is at a very early stage. Here, what is known about marine plastisphere assemblages is systematically compared with up-to-date findings from freshwater habitats. Through analysis of key differences and likely commonalities between environments, we discuss how an integrated view of these fields of research will enhance our knowledge of the complex behavior and ecological impacts of microplastic pollutants.},

Concerns over potential negative impacts on the economy, wildlife, and human health provide strong incentives for improving the sustainable use of plastics. Despite the many voices raised on the issue, we lack a consensus on how to define and categorize plastic debris. This is evident for microplastics, where inconsistent size classes are used and where the materials to be included are under debate. While this is inherent in an emerging research field, an ambiguous terminology results in confusion and miscommunication that may compromise progress in research and mitigation measures. Therefore, we need to be explicit on what exactly we consider plastic debris. Thus, we critically discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a unified terminology, propose a definition and categorization framework, and highlight areas of uncertainty. Going beyond size classes, our framework includes physicochemical properties (polymer composition, solid state, solubility) as defining criteria and size, shape, color, and origin as classifiers for categorization. Acknowledging the rapid evolution of our knowledge on plastic pollution, our framework will promote consensus building within the scientific and regulatory community based on a solid scientific foundation.},

It is evident, however, that temporal and spatial variations of MP occurrence do (and will) occur. To further improve the estimations of the role of MPs as vectors for HOC transfer into biota under varying MP concentrations and environmental conditions, it is important to identify and understand the governing processes.

We discuss intrinsic and extrinsic parameters influencing these processes and focus on the importance of the exposure route for diffusive mass transfer.

The nitrate concentration in influent was about 45 mgN/L. The other was wastewater from a plastic greenhouse. The nitrate concentration in inflow water was about 200 mgN/L. Nitrate was almost removed by the containers packed with sulfur (S0)-CaCO3 blocks in both sites. Increase of sulfate indicated that nitrate was removed by sulfur denitrification. This was also estimated stoichiometrically from the relationships between the removed nitrate and produced sulfate. The N2O was supersaturated in water at most sampling points and the highest concentration of dissolved N2O reached 900 microgN/L in Saitama in March. It seemed that insufficient nitrate removal caused accumulation of intermediates during denitrification, such as nitrite and N2O, in this month. However, the emission ratio of N2O to the removed nitrate during these processes was kept low, ranging from 0.01 to 0.19\%, at both two sites throughout all surveys.},

During summer and autumn, soil moisture content measured at monthly intervals was higher under mulched than unmulched conditions. Levels of extractable nitrate and sulphate in soils during autumn followed the order: clear mulch = black mulch {$>$} white mulch {$>$} no mulch. However, there were no significant differences in levels of enzyme activity or concentrations of biomass N, S or P between treatments. There were significant seasonal fluctuations in estimates of biomass N, S and P, but there was no close relationship between fluctuations in any estimate. This discrepancy was attributed to errors in the chloroform fumigation technique. Enzyme activities showed significant temporal fluctuations but the three enzymes did not show similar times of minimum and maximum activity. The complexity of interactions between soil microbial and biochemical properties and nutrient availability was exemplified by the absence of a discernible relationship between seasonal fluctuations in enzyme activities and levels of biomass N, S and P and/or levels of extractable mineral N, S and P in the soil.

It was investigated if Lent could work as a ‘window of opportunity’ of habit change, expecting people to be open to try new behaviour in this period. An online survey was conducted before, during and after Lent. 140 persons in three different intervention groups, including an invitation to the plastic challenge (baseline), information about problems (group I) and information about action steps (group II) participated by the end. Mixed ANOVA revealed a reduction of plastic consumption during Lent (d = 0.69). This effect was maintained even after Lent. Informational approaches showed no further effect. Path analysis revealed insights in antecedents of fasting behaviour and habit change. Intention, previous behaviour and moral norms were direct predictors of plastic reduction during Lent. In turn, people who reduced plastic consumption in this period continued it after Lent independent of other constructs. Implications of these results are discussed.},

As technical solutions might be insufficient to curb the problem, a perspective highlighting the impact of human behavior is needed. The current literature review provides an overview of the existing social-scientific literature on plastic, ranging from risk awareness, consumers' preferences, and predictors of usage behavior to political and psychological intervention strategies. By reviewing the literature, we aim to identify potential factors for future interventions to reduce plastic consumption. The 187 studies reviewed show that people much appreciate and routinely use plastic, despite a pronounced awareness of the associated problems. Habits, norms, and situational factors seem to be especially predictive for plastic consumption behavior. Both political and psychological interventions are potentially effective, although long-term effects are often uncertain. The review closes with implications for behavior-based solutions and future research, which should combine interdisciplinary approaches and take into account cultural differences.},

Bioturbation displaces microplastics ({$>$}1 μm) in soils and likely also nanoplastics ({$<$}1 μm), but empirical evidence is lacking. We used a combination of methods that allowed us to not only quantify but to also understand the mechanisms of biologically driven transport of nanoplastics in microcosms with the deep-burrowing earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. We hypothesized that ingestion and subsurface excretion drives deep vertical transport of nanoplastics that subsequently accumulate in the drilosphere, i.e., burrow walls. Significant vertical transport of palladium-doped polystyrene nanoplastics (diameter 256 nm), traceable using elemental analysis, was observed and increased over 4 weeks. Nanoplastics were detected in depurated earthworms confirming their uptake without any detectable negative impact. Nanoplastics were indeed enriched in the drilosphere where cast material was visibly incorporated, and the reuse of initial burrows could be monitored via X-ray computed tomography. Moreover, the speed of nanoplastics transport to the deeper soil profile could not be explained with a local mixing model. Earthworms thus repeatedly ingested and excreted nanoplastics in the drilosphere calling for a more explicit inclusion of bioturbation in nanoplastic fate modeling under consideration of the dominant mechanism. Further investigation is required to quantify nanoplastic re-entrainment, such as during events of preferential flow in burrows.},

For the optimal use of films in horticulture, it is necessary to quantify this effect, which depends particularly on the optical properties of the film. Five films, used mainly for soil covering in asparagus cultivation, were tested by measuring the soil temperature as well as the transmittance and reflectance in the short- and long-wavelength bands: ‘Taschenfolie schwarz/weiß’, a film with black and white surfaces and pockets for fastening; ‘Antitaufolie’, a film with anti-condensation coating, ‘Solartherm plus Folie’, a film with black top and transparent sides; ‘MaterBi Folie’, a biodegradable film; and ‘Thermoplus Folie’, a black polyethylene with transparent sides. All films were produced in Germany. The temperature measurements were carried out under controlled irradiation (short-wavelength band) and ambient temperature conditions in the laboratory: first, 182 W m−2 and 11 °C at a depth of 0.4 m, and second, 340 W m−2 at 20 °C. A significant relationship between the temperature increase or decrease by covering the soil with the film and the calculated apparent quantities of the reflectance in the short and long-wavelength band was derived (r2 = 0.85, n = 12). Furthermore, first tests with a physical model were carried out to obtain basic information, which should be used in the development of strategies for film management in the field.

Here, we report on the development and validation of a novel fluorescent counterstaining technique for detection of microplastics within terrestrial invertebrate biomass and fecal material. After being stained with a blend of Calcofluor white and Evans blue dyes in addition to Nile red, ground arthropod biomass appeared blueish-purple, whereas different plastic polymers appeared red, green, and yellow when viewed under laser scanning confocal microscopy. Nonarthropod invertebrate biomass and fecal material were also distinguishable from plastic, though to a lesser extent. Our results highlight the value of this method for detecting microplastic ingestion by terrestrial invertebrates.},

However, microplastics are unique among pollutants due to the diversity of ways in which soil organisms may themselves be able to affect their occurrence and distribution and mediate their effects on the rest of the soil food web. In this review, we argue for a more explicitly ecological framing of this novel issue for the soil environment and discuss their potential interactions with soil communities, including microplastic formation via microbial and faunal fragmentation of large plastic debris and organisms such as earthworms placing microplastic particles in unique pedological contexts they could not otherwise reach. Ecological interactions may be crucial for dictating microplastics’ ultimate fate and effect on terrestrial ecosystems.

In spite of the presence of microplastics in soils, no standardized methods are available for the quantification. Uniform protocols including microplastic extraction and identification are urgently needed to develop. In soil environments, main sources of microplastics include mulching film, sludge, wastewater irrigation and atmospheric deposition. The fate of microplastics is closely related to soil physio-chemistry and biota. Existing evidence shows that microplastics can influence soil biota at different trophic levels, and even threaten human health through food chains. Therefore, further research is needed to fully reveal the fate and ecological risks of microplastics in soils; and necessary action is required to control microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Analytical methodology, including estimates of ambient contamination during sample collection and processing,~are described and employed. Microscopy, pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to quantify and identify microplastic particles. In surface waters, fibers were the most frequently observed morphology, and, based upon PyGC/MS analysis, ~polyvinyl chloride was the most frequently observed polymer, followed by polypropylene and polyethylene. The most common polymer identified by FTIR was polyethylene. Despite the low human population in Lake Superior’s watershed, microplastic particles (particularly fibers, fragments, and films) were identified in western-lake surface waters at levels comparable to average values reported in studies within Lake Michigan, the North Atlantic Ocean, and the South Pacific Ocean. This study provides insight into the magnitude of microplastic pollution in western Lake Superior, and describes in detail methodology to improve future microplastics studies in aquatic systems.},

Microplastics (i.e., plastic particles less than 5mm in size) have been identified as a global environmental threat for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health. Agriculture is assumed to be both victim and polluter of microplastic pollution. Agricultural soils receive microplastic immissions from tire wear and fragmented macroplastic that enters the environment through littering. Furthermore, farmers who fertilize their arable land with sewage sludge and compost unintentionally apply the microplastic particles contained in these biosolids. On the other hand, agricultural soils may emit microplastics into aquatic environment. Because of this ambivalent position as both victim and polluter, the information on microplastic pollution is of current interest for agricultural production and might become a relevant topic for agro-environmental policies in the future. Our research aims to quantify the microplastic immissions into agricultural soils and emissions from agricultural soils into aquatic systems. We use different analysis approaches and interdisciplinary modelling to address these aims for two case studies in Germany. Because research in microplastics is a relatively new concern, we combine different methodological approaches in a complementary way.},

  abstract = {The substance class of inert organic-chemical stressors (IOCS) describes organic-chemical (macro-) molecules, which demonstrate a high level of persistence upon entry in the ecosystem, and whose degradation is limited. These synthetically produced organic-chemical macromolecules, which are often derived from the polymerization of different monomers, are, in the form of plastics, indispensable in the everyday world. They enter the environmental compartments and cause great damage due to primary (industry, cosmetic, washing of textile), and secondary (degradation) entry. If these particles get into aquatic systems, this has fatal consequences for the ecosystem such as the death of marine animals, or bioaccumulation. Wastewater treatment plants are reaching their limits and require innovative ideas for the sustainable removal of microplastic. This article examines a new approach to the removal of polymers from aquatic systems (lab scale) by using sol–gel induced agglomeration reactions to form larger particle agglomerates. These enlarged agglomerates can be separated much more easily from the wastewater, since they float on the water surface. Separation systems, e.g. sand trap can easily be used. A further advantage is that the agglomeration can be carried out completely independently of the type, size, and amount of the trace substance concentration as well as of the external influences (pH value, temperature, pressure). Thus, this new type of particle separation can not only be used in sewage treatment plants, but can also be transferred to decentralized systems (e.g. implementation in industrial processes).Graphical Abstract Open image in new window},

  abstract = {Environmental pollution caused by inert anthropogenic stressors such as microplastics in aquatic media is constantly increasing. Through the proliferating use of plastic products in daily life, more and more plastic particles enter waters as primary microplastics. Even though large scale plastic items such as plastic bottles and bags represent the highest percentage of plastic waste, their degeneration also generates microparticles and nanoparticles (secondary microplastics). Modern sewage treatment plants require innovative ideas in order to deal with this man-made problem. State-of-the-art technology offers approaches to minimise the amount of microplastics in aquatic systems. These technologies, however, are either insufficient or very costly, as well as time-consuming in both cases. The conceptual idea presented here is to apply innovative inorganic-organic hybrid silica gels which provide a cost-effective and straightforward approach. Currently, the synthesis of preorganised bioinspired compounds is advancing in order to produce functionalised hybrid silica gels in a further step. These gels have the ability to remove stressors such as microplastics from waste water. By means of the sol-gel process, bioinspired silane compounds are currently being permuted to macromolecules and examined with respect to their properties as fixation and filter material in order to remove the hydrophobic anthropogenic stressors sustainably. Here, the reproduction of biological systems plays a significant role. In particular in material sciences, this approach is becoming increasingly important. Among other concepts, new biomimetic molecules form the basis for the investigation of innovative host-guest relationships for anthropogenic stressors in the environment and their implementation in technical processes.},

This study aimed to assess the production potential, performance, and water use efficiency (WUE) of rice under plastic mulching with drip irrigation. Field experiments were conducted over 2 years with two rice cultivars under different cultivation systems: conventional flooding (CF), non-flooded irrigation incorporating plastic mulching with furrow irrigation (FIM), non-mulching with furrow irrigation (FIN), and plastic mulching with drip irrigation (DI). Compared with the CF treatment, grain yields were reduced by 31.76-52.19\% under the DI treatment, by 57.16-61.02\% under the FIM treatment, by 74.40-75.73\% under the FIN treatment, which were mainly from source limitation, especially a low dry matter accumulation during post-anthesis, in non-flooded irrigation. WUE was the highest in the DI treatment, being 1.52-2.12 times higher than with the CF treatment, 1.35-1.89 times higher than with the FIM treatment, and 2.37-3.78 times higher than with the FIN treatment. The yield contribution from tillers (YCFTs) was 50.65-62.47\% for the CF treatment and 12.07-20.62\% for the non-flooded irrigation treatments. These low YCFTs values were attributed to the poor performance in tiller panicles rather than the total tiller number. Under non-flooded irrigation, root length was significantly reduced with more roots distributed in deep soil layers compared with the CF treatment; the DI treatment had more roots in the topsoil layer than the FIM and FIN treatments. The experiment demonstrates that the DI treatment has greater water saving capacity and lower yield and economic benefit gaps than the FIM and FIN treatments compared with the CF treatment, and would therefore be a better water-saving technology in areas of water scarcity.}

  abstract = {Microplastics are now recognized as a persistent and global pollutant. To quantitively measure microplastics in environmental matrices, several techniques are used including new methods using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py–GC/MS). In the present study, a new extraction method using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) combined with Py–GC/MS was developed to extract and quantify a wide range of plastic polymers, and the method was validated using different environmental matrices. This new extraction method was able to extract polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polycarbonate in dichloromethane with good recoveries (92.9–119.7\%). The limit of detection and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method ranged from 0.002 to 0.18 µg and from 1.2 to 5.8 µg, respectively. Intra- and interday repeatability values with coefficients of variation less than 25\% for all polymers were obtained. Method validation also included a spike and recovery using all polymers from clean water, dirty water, and shrimp and salmon fillet samples, with recoveries of 85 to 111, 87 to 138, 81 to 122, and 50 to 151\%, respectively. Finally, the method was tested on unspiked wild mussels and bottled water for proof-of-concept. Both polyethylene and PVC were detected and quantified in mussels, and polycarbonate and polypropylene were detected below the LOQ. For bottled water, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polycarbonate were all detected below the LOQ. We introduce a method combining MAE and Py–GC/MS as a tool for mass quantification of microplastics. This method can be used as a stand-alone, or as a complementary method to spectroscopic techniques. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1–9. © 2021 SETAC},

  abstract = {Plastics are found to be major debris composing marine litter; microplastics (MP, {$<$} 5 mm) are found in all marine compartments. The amount of MPs tends to increase with decreasing size leading to a potential misidentification when only visual identification is performed. These last years, pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) has been used to get information on the composition of polymers with some applications on MP identification. The purpose of this work was to optimize and then validate a Py-GC/MS method, determine limit of detection (LOD) for eight common polymers, and apply this method on environmental MP. Optimization on multiple GC parameters was carried out using polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) microspheres. The optimized Py-GC/MS method require a pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C, a split ratio of 5 and 300 °C as injector temperature. Performance assessment was accomplished by performing repeatability and intermediate precision tests and calculating limit of detection (LOD) for common polymers. LODs were all below 1 μg. For performance assessment, identification remains accurate despite a decrease in signal over time. A comparison between identifications performed with Raman micro spectroscopy and with Py-GC/MS was assessed. Finally, the optimized method was applied to environmental samples, including plastics isolated from sea water surface, beach sediments, and organisms collected in the marine environment. The present method is complementary to μ-Raman spectroscopy as Py-GC/MS identified pigment containing particles as plastic. Moreover, some fibers and all particles from sediment and sea surface were identified as plastic. Open image in new window Graphical abstract ᅟ},

Current studies, however, portray a wide spread in results on the occurrence of microplastic ingestion, highlighting a lack of comparability of results, which might be attributed to a lack of standardization of methods. We critically review and evaluate recent microplastic ingestion studies in aquatic biota, propose a quality assessment method for such studies, and apply the assessment method to the reviewed studies. The quality assessment method uses ten criteria: sampling method and strategy, sample size, sample processing and storage, laboratory preparation, clean air conditions, negative controls, positive controls, target component, sample (pre)treatment, and polymer identification. The results of this quality assessment show a dire need for stricter quality assurance in microplastic ingestion studies. On average, studies score 8.0 out of 20 points for “completeness of information” and 0 for “reliability”. Alongside the assessment method, a standardized protocol for detecting microplastic in biota samples incorporating these criteria is provided.},

  abstract = {The scientific and public interest regarding environmental pollution with microplastic has considerably increased within the last 15 years. Nevertheless, up to now there is no widely applied standard operation procedure for microplastic sampling, resulting in a lack of inter-study comparability. In addition, many studies on microplastic occurrences do not indicate a sound methodological validation of the applied methods and procedures. This study presents an alternative volume-reduced sampling technique to sample the entire load of suspended particulate matter including microplastic particles in natural waters, based on continuous flow centrifugation. For the lab-scale validation of the proposed instrumental setup, six different microplastic types (PE, PET, PS, PVDC, EPS and PP) were used. The particles covered a size range from 1 μm to 1 mm and a density range from 0.94 g mL-1 to 1.63 g mL-1. Recoveries ranged from 95.0\% ± 2.3\% - 99.1\% ± 0.3\% for virgin powders and from 96.1\% ± 0.6\% - 99.4\% ± 0.2\% (1 SD, n = 2 - 3) for microplastic suspended in river water for 40 days. Gravimetric and microscopic analysis of the effluent indicates efficient removal of microplastic from the suspensions. Static light scattering analysis of the microplastic suspensions prior to and after centrifugation confirmed that no change of the particle size distribution has occurred – neither through aggregation nor through size-discrimination during centrifugation. Moreover, the system was tested in the field and used twice to sample suspended particulate matter from the Elbe estuary directly on site. Based on these first lab-scale experiments, continuous flow centrifugation proves a promising technique bearing potential to alleviate drawbacks such as contamination, filter clogging and particle size-discrimination of commonly used volume-reduced microplastic sampling approaches.},

Detritivores, such as amphipods, ingest and shred natural organic matter and are fundamental to its breakdown. Here we examine ingestion and shredding of plastic carrier bags by Orchestia gammarellus. A laboratory experiment showed these amphipods shredded plastic carrier bags, generating numerous microplastic fragments (average diameter 488.59μm). The presence of a biofilm significantly increased the amount of shredding, but plastic type (conventional, degradable and biodegradable) had no effect. Subsequent field observations confirmed similar shredding occurred on the strandline. Rates of shredding will vary according to amphipod density; however, our data indicates that shredding by organisms could substantially accelerate the formation microplastics in the environment.},

In adsorption experiments fragmented HDPE bags c. one mm2 in size showed similar sorption characteristics to soil. However, when present in combination with soil, concentrations of adsorbed Zn on a per mass basis were over an order of magnitude lower on microplastics. Desorption of the Zn was minimal from both microplastics and soil in synthetic soil solution (0.01 M CaCl2), but in synthetic earthworm guts desorption was higher from microplastics (40–60\%) than soil (2–15\%), suggesting microplastics could increase Zn bioavailability. Individual Lumbricus terrestris earthworms exposed for 28 days in mesocosms of 260 g moist soil containing 0.35 wt \% of Zn-bearing microplastic (236–4505 mg kg–1) ingested the microplastics, but there was no evidence of Zn accumulation, mortality, or weight change. Digestion of the earthworms showed that they did not retain microplastics in their gut. These findings indicate that microplastics could act as vectors to increase metal exposure in earthworms, but that the associated risk is unlikely to be significant for essential metals such as Zn that are well regulated by metabolic processes.},

Rivers are a source of microplastic (i.e., particles {$<$}5\,mm) to oceans, but few measurements of microplastic retention in rivers exist. We adapted spiraling metrics used to measure particulate organic matter transport to quantify microplastic deposition using an outdoor experimental stream. We conducted replicated pulse releases of three common microplastics: polypropylene pellets, polystyrene fragments, and acrylic fibers, repeating measurements using particles with and without biofilms. Depositional velocity (vdep; mm/s) patterns followed expectations based on density and biofilm ‘stickiness’, where vdep was highest for fragments, intermediate for fibers, and lowest for pellets, with biofilm colonization generally increasing vdep. Comparing microplastic vdep to values for natural particles (e.g., fine and coarse particulate organic matter) showed that particle diameter was positively related to vdep and negatively related to the ratio of vdep to settling velocity (i.e., sinking rate in standing water). Thus, microplastic vdep in rivers can be quantified with the same methods and follows the same patterns as natural particles. These data are the first measurements of microplastic deposition in rivers, and directly inform models of microplastic transport at the landscape scale, making a key contribution to research on the global ecology of plastic waste.},

To assess the current status of phthalate esters (PAEs) of soil residues, soil samples (0 similar to 20 cm) (n = 82) were collected in Bincheng District, at the geographic center of the YRD. PAEs were detected in all topsoil samples analyzed, which indicated that PAEs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Concentrations of 11 PAEs are in the range of 0.794 similar to 19.504 mu g g(-1), with an average value of 2.975 mu g g(-1). It was presented that PAEs pollution in this area was weak and monotonously increasing along the rural-urban gradient. Higher concentrations were observed from roadsides (and/or gutters), densely anthropogenic activities areas (such as the urbanization and industrialization), and agriculture influence district, which mainly originated from construction waste, municipal sewage, agricultural waste and pesticide, discarded plastic effusion and atmospheric depositions. Concentrations of PAEs were weakly positivity correlated with soil organic carbon content and pH, which suggested both of them can affect the distribution of PAEs. The concentration of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate dominated in the 11 PAEs, with the average values of 0.735 and 1.915 mu g g(-1), respectively, and accounted for 92.1 \% of the whole PAEs' concentrations. No significant differences of PAE congeneric profiles were observed between our work and others previously reported, which is consistent with the use of similar commercial PAEs around the world.},

Thus, even in a complex ecosystem, when plasticizers are degraded, the breakdown is not complete and significant amounts of 2-ethylhexanoic acid and 2-ethylhexanol are observed. These compounds have been shown to exhibit acute toxicity using Microtox, Daphnia, rainbow trout and fathead minnow toxicity assays. Since it is already well established that plasticizers are ubiquitous in the environment, it is expected that their recalcitrant metabolites will also be ubiquitous.

In field experiments in Israel during the summer, maximum soil temperature under plastic cover at the 5-cm depth averaged 46 to 49C. No weeds emerged under the plastic cover during solarization and weed emergence was reduced after its removal. The heating effect from solarization decreased with soil depth. Concentration of O2 in soil under plastic was similar to that in uncovered controls, but the concentration of CO2 was markedly higher than in control soil, rising up to 2.4\%. Higher temperatures and better residual weed control were produced by transparent than by black plastic, with best results from thin (0.03 mm), transparent polyethylene. Under Israeli summer conditions, 2 to 4 weeks of solarization produced effective control of annual weeds that was still appreciable after 1 yr. Narrow sheets of 20 to 50 cm produced effective weed control in bands. on soil irrigated once before placing the plastic sheets, there was no need to irrigate during solarization. The response of weed species to solarization differed. Many annual weeds, both summer species such as pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) and winter species as henbit (Lamium amplexicaule L.) were well controlled by solarization. Broomrape (Orobanche crenata Forsk.) was controlled in one experiment. on the other hand, horseweed [Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq.] and bull mallow (Malva niceaensis All.) were relatively resistant, and established perennials escaped the treatment.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution is widespread across the globe, pervading land, water, and air. These environments are commonly considered independently, however, in reality these are closely linked. This review gives an overview of the background knowledge surrounding sources, fate and transport of microplastics within the environment. We introduce a new “Plastic Cycle” concept in order to better understand the processes influencing flux and retention of microplastics between and across the wide range of environmental matrices. As microplastics are a pervasive, persistent and potentially harmful pollutant, an understanding of these processes will allow for assessment of exposure to better determine the likely long-term ecological and human health implications of microplastic pollution.

  abstract = {Quantitative thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) method was developed for the determination of the composition of gases evolved during the decomposition of solids. The present method is based on the linear relationship between the amount of evolved gases and the peak area for corresponding fragment ion via proportionality constant (K) which gains the similar values for all evolved gaseous products. Determination and verification of K were performed with the various initial mass of CaC2O4∙H2O decomposing with the evolution of H2O, CO, and CO2. The resulted values of the proportionality constants reach (3.32±0.11)×107 for H2O, (3.35±0.08)×107 for CO, and (3.27±0.07)×107 for CO2. The developed TG-MS method was verified at the decomposition of (COOH)2∙2H2O, NaHCO3 and HCOONa. By applying the average value of K for the determination of the composition of gaseous products evolved from the previously mentioned three substances, a quite good correspondence between theoretically and experimentally calculated composition can be found. The results imply that developed TG-MS method might be a useful tool to detect quantitatively the amount of evolved gases during the thermal decomposition of carbonaceous materials.},

  abstract = {Plastic mulching is suspected to be a significant source of microplastics in terrestrial environments owing to its intensive application and improper disposal. However, there has been a comparative lack of studies examining this hypothesis. In this study, the occurrence of macroplastics in agricultural soils was investigated by analysing 384 soil samples collected from 19 provinces across China. Additionally, the abundance of microplastics was investigated in potential hotspots that have carried out plastic mulching for over 30 years. Macroplastic concentrations in the soil samples ranged from 0.1 to 324.5~kg/ha, with an average of 83.6~kg/ha; the concentrations were higher in western China than in eastern China. A highly significant linear correlation (R2~=~0.61) was found between the consumption of mulching film and the plastic residue in soils, indicating plastic film mulching may be a major source of macroplastics. The abundances of microplastic particles increased over time in the locations where plastic mulching was continuously employed, with concentrations of 80.3~±~49.3, 308~±~138.1, and 1075.6~±~346.8 pieces/kg soil in fields with 5, 15, and 24~y of continuous mulching, respectively. Fourier transform infrared analyses revealed that the composition of the microplastics matched that of the mulching films, suggesting the microplastic particles originated from the mulching films. These findings confirm that plastic mulching is an important source of macroplastic and microplastic contamination in terrestrial environments. Further studies to investigate the microplastic hazards in soils are thus necessary.},

Most of existing studies have focused on MP pollution in marine, freshwater, and sediment systems. However, much less research attention has been paid to soil, which is a major sink of MPs. Furthermore, research interest in MPs in groundwater is even lower than that in soils. There is a critical need to digest and summarize the existing knowledge and the latest advancements to promote research on MP pollution in soils and groundwater. As the first of its kind, this work provides a systematical review of the newest knowledge on occurrences, sources, analytical methods, and impacts of MPs in both soils and groundwater. It first outlines the characteristics (global occurrences, sources, and pathways) of MP pollution in soils and groundwater. Commonly used analytical methods including sample collection (sites, tools, depth, points, and quantity), sample preparation (drying and sieving), extraction (separation, digestion, etc.), identification (visual sorting, chromatography, and vibration spectroscopy), and quality assurance/quality control are then systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the risks and impacts of MPs on soil properties, plants, animals, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between microorganisms and humans are discussed. At the end, this review also identifies the knowledge gaps and points out potential directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Bioavailability of phthalate congeners, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and dioctyl phthalate, to earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were studied when earthworms were exposed to two artificially contaminated agricultural and forest soils. Only DBP and DEHP were detected in earthworms. The uptake kinetics of DBP and DEHP in earthworms was fast within the initial 10 days followed by a nearly steady state for the subsequent 20 days. An equilibrium partitioning model could be used to describe the uptake kinetics of DBP and DEHP by earthworm in two types of soils ( r = 0.709 – 0.864 ). The average biota-to-soil accumulation factors (BSAFs) of DBP and DEHP at 5 mg kg−1 in soil were 0.27±0.07 and 0.17±0.03, respectively, in agricultural soil, while the BSAFs were 0.21±0.06 and 0.07±0.02, respectively, in forest soil. The concentrations of phthalates in earthworms increased with increasing concentrations of phthalates in soil. There was a significant correlation between log C soil and log C worm , with r = 0.999 – 0.993 , demonstrating a single linear partitioning of phthalates between soil and earthworms. The bioavailability of DBP and DEHP was assessed by Soxhlet, methanol, and methanol–water (1:1) extraction methods. Our results indicated that the extractable amounts of freshly added DBP and DEHP in soils by these extraction methods were significantly correlated with those in earthworms. It was observed that the extractable DBP and DEHP by the methanol and methanol–water (1:1) extraction methods decreased with their increasing residence time in soil. In contrast, the amount extracted by the Soxhlet extraction method did not show a similar decline. Therefore, Soxhlet extraction was a poor indicator of the bioavailability of DBP and DEHP to earthworms in soil, which could lead to overestimation of the risk of soil-associated DBP and DEHP. The extractable DBP and DEHP by methanol and methanol–water (1:1) significantly decreased over 440 days. Compared with the methanol–water (1:1) extraction method, the methanol extraction method was preferred for its ability to predict the bioavailability of DBP and DEHP in aged soils.},

The presence of PSNP dramatically enhanced the mobility of naphthalene at low IS (0.5~mM), but such effect was prohibited at high IS (5~mM and 50~mM). The mobility of PSNP in the sand column was higher when it was solely exist in the pore-water than that when in the presence of naphthalene, because of the charge-shielding effect. This work showed that the coexistence of PSNP and naphthalene would influence the mobility of each other in the saturated porous media, which highly related to their concentration ratio and IS levels.},

Till now, most previous studies have focused on the identification and characterization of microplastics in freshwater, sea water, and the terrestrial environment. Although microplastics have been extensively detected in the wastewater, research in this area is still lacking and not thoroughly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, the current review article covers the analytical methods of microplastics originating from wastewater streams and describes their sources and occurrences in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Studies indicated that microplastic pollution caused by domestic washing of synthetic fibers could be detected in the effluent; however, most microplastics from personal care and cosmetic products (PCCPs) can be efficiently removed during wastewater treatment. Moreover, various techniques for sampling and analyzing microplastics from wastewater systems are reviewed; while, the implementation of standardized protocols for microplastics is required. Finally, the fate of microplastics during wastewater treatments and the environmental contamination of effluent to environment are presented. Previous studies reported that the advanced wastewater treatment (e.g., membrane bioreactor) is needed for improving the removal efficiency of small-sized microplastics ({$<$}\,100~µm). Although the role of microplastics as transport vectors for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is still under debate, they have demonstrated abilities to absorb harmful agents like pharmaceuticals.},

However, current methods of MP removal from an aqueous environment are limited by low efficiency. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are emerging techniques for MP purification. Herein, a hydrothermal coupled Fenton system is developed for decomposition of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene, achieving 95.9\% weight loss in 16 h and 75.6\% mineralization efficiency in 12 h. The high effectiveness is attributed to the synergy of hydrothermal hydrolysis, proton-rich environment, and massive production of hydroxyl radicals. The system is also efficient to remediate different petroleum-based plastics and maintains high efficiency in practical water bodies. Characterizations revealed a two-stage degradation process: chain unfolding/stretching and oxidation, giving rise to the formation of carbonyl groups and decreased crystallinity of MPs during the hydrothermal treatment. The chain stretching stage is pivotal to the whole treatment because it remarkably facilitates subsequent chain cleavage and Fenton oxidation. This study provides a new approach to removing MPs in water bodies and new insights into MP degradation by the AOP technology.},

  abstract = {Pollution caused by plastic debris is an urgent environmental problem. Here, we assessed the effects of microplastics in the soil surface litter on the formation and characterization of burrows built by the anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris in soil and quantified the amount of microplastics that was transported and deposited in L.~terrestris burrows. Worms were exposed to soil surface litter treatments containing microplastics (Low Density Polyethylene) for 2~weeks at concentrations of 0\%, 7\%, 28\%, 45\% and 60\%. The latter representing environmentally realistic concentrations found in hot spot soil locations. There were significantly more burrows found when soil was exposed to the surface treatment composed of 7\% microplastics than in all other treatments. The highest amount of organic matter in the walls of the burrows was observed after using the treatments containing 28 and 45\% microplastics. The highest microplastic bioturbation efficiency ratio (total microplastics (mg) in burrow walls/initial total surface litter microplastics (mg)) was found using the concentration of 7\% microplastics, where L.~terrestris introduced 73.5\% of the surface microplastics into the burrow walls. The highest burrow wall microplastic content per unit weight of soil (11.8~±~4.8~g~kg-1) was found using a concentration of 60\% microplastics. L.~terrestris was responsible for size-selective downward transport when exposed to concentrations of 7, 28 and 45\% microplastics in the surface litter, as the fraction ≤50~μm microplastics in burrow walls increased by 65\% compared to this fraction in the original surface litter plastic. We conclude that the high biogenic incorporation rate of the small-fraction microplastics from surface litter into burrow walls causes a risk of leaching through preferential flow into groundwater bodies. Furthermore, this leaching may have implications for the subsequent availability of microplastics to terrestrial organisms or for the transport of plastic-associated organic contaminants in soil.},

Growth rate was significantly reduced at 28, 45, and 60\% w/w microplastics, compared to the 7\% and control treatments. Due to the digestion of ingested organic matter, microplastic was concentrated in cast, especially at the lowest dose (i.e., 7\% in litter) because that dose had the highest proportion of digestible organic matter. Whereas 50 percent of the microplastics had a size of {$<$}50 mu m in the original litter, 90 percent of the microplastics in the casts was {$<$}50 mu m in all treatments, which suggests size-selective egestion by the earthworms.

The presence of microplastics in soil, including polyethylene, can affect the transport of hydrophobic organic pollutants including pesticides. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of polyethylene microplastics ({$<$}250 μm) on the transport of two selected organic plant-protection agents (atrazine and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid) in soil under different aqueous conditions, using inverse liquid chromatography. The distribution coefficients for the sorbates that were sorbed to pure polyethylene microplastic were found to be significantly smaller than those for the sorbates sorbed to pure soil. The addition of 10\% (w/w) polyethylene to the soil therefore led to an overall reduction in sorption, but the sorption trends due to variations in pH and ionic strength were not affected. The results imply that the presence of polyethylene microplastics in soil may therefore increase the mobility of organic contaminants by reducing the sorption capacity of natural soils, which must be validated by further research.},

Sorption of organic compounds by microplastics may affect the phase distribution within both sediments and aqueous phases. To investigate this process, isotherms were determined for the sorption of seven aliphatic and aromatic organic probe sorbates by four polymers with different physico-chemical properties. Sorption increased in the order polyamide~{$<~$}polyethylene~{$<~$}polyvinylchloride~{$<~$}polystyrene. This order does not reflect the particle sizes of the investigated microplastics within the aqueous dispersions, indicating the influence of additional factors (e.g., π-π-interactions) on the sorption of aromatic compounds by polystyrene. Linear isotherms by polyethylene suggested that sorbate uptake was due to absorption into the bulk polymer. In contrast, non-linear isotherms for sorption by PS, PA, and PVC suggest a predominance of adsorption onto the polymer surface, which is supported by the best fit of these isotherms using the Polanyi-Manes model. A strong relationship between the sorption coefficients of the microplastics and the hydrophobicity of the sorbates suggests that hydrophobic interactions are of major importance.},

Understanding the sorption interactions between aged microplastics and organic contaminants is therefore essential for evaluating the impact of microplastics on the environment. There is little information available on how the aging of microplastics affects their sorption behavior and other properties. We have therefore investigated the effects of an accelerated UV-aging procedure on polystyrene microplastics, which are used in products such as skin cleaners and foams. Physical and chemical particle characterizations showed that aging led to significant surface oxidation and minor localized microcrack formation. Sorption coefficients of organic compounds by polystyrene microplastics following aging were up to one order of magnitude lower than for pristine particles. Sorption isotherms were experimentally determined using a diverse set of probe sorbates covering a variety of substance classes allowing an in-depth evaluation of the poly-parameter linear free-energy relationship (ppLFER) modelling used to investigate the contribution of individual molecular interactions to overall sorption. The ppLFER modelling was validated using internal cross-validation, which confirmed its robustness. This approach therefore yields improved estimates of the interactions between aged polystyrene microplastics and organic contaminants.},

  abstract = {In northern climates where the growing season is shortened by cool spring conditions, high tunnels make it possible to plant and produce tomatoes (Solanum, lycopersicum L.) at least 1 month earlier than in the field. However, limited high-tunnel research has been performed in arid high-elevation regions that experience extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations. High tunnels are designed to be passively heated; therefore, additional protection from frost may be warranted if growers wish to plant significantly earlier than normal. Low tunnels built within a high tunnel reduce the energy requirement by concentrating heat around the plants, particularly when a heat source is placed inside the low tunnel. 'Sunbrite' tomatoes were transplanted through black plastic mulch in four high tunnels in North Logan, UT (lat. 41.73 degrees N, long. 111.83 degrees W, 1382 m elevation) on 17 Mar., 30 Mar., and 7 Apr. in 2009 and on 19 Mar., 30 Mar., and 9 Apr. in 2010. Low tunnels were constructed over each row, and three supplemental heat treatments (unheated, soil-warming cables, and soil-warming cables plus 40-W incandescent lights) were tested to improve plant performance. The highest total marketable yield was achieved for earliest planting dates in both 2009 and 2010. In 2009, early-season yield was significantly greater when both the soil + air were heated, but only for the earliest planting date. In 2010, soil heat alone and in conjunction with air heat significantly improved early-season yield. Information gathered in this study on planting dates, yield, and energy costs provides valuable production and economic information to growers in arid high-elevation climates who desire the benefits of growing early-season tomatoes in high tunnels.},

This study investigated four main protocols for the removal of organic material during analysis of microplastics from complex solid matrices: oxidation using H2O2, Fenton’s reagent, and alkaline digestion with NaOH and KOH. Eight common polymer types were used to assess the influence of reagent exposure on particle integrity. Organic matter removal efficiencies were established for test sludge and soil samples. Fenton’s reagent was identified as the optimum protocol. All other methods showed signs of particle degradation or resulted in an insufficient reduction in organic matter content. A further validation procedure revealed high microplastic extraction efficiencies for particles with different morphologies. This confirmed the suitability of Fenton’s reagent for use in conjunction with density separation for extracting microplastics. This approach affords greater comparability with existing studies that utilize a density-based technique. Recommendations for further method optimization were also identified to improve the recovery of microplastic from complex, organic-rich environmental samples.},

Plastics and the Environment provides state-of-the-art technical and research information on the complex relationship between the plastic and polymer industry and the environment, focusing on the sustainability, environmental impact, and cost-benefit tradeoffs associated with different technologies. Bringing together the field's leading researchers, Anthony Andrady's innovative collection not only covers how plastics affect the environment, but also how environmental factors affect plastics. The relative benefits of recycling, resource recovery, and energy recovery are also discussed in detail. The first of the book's four sections represents a basic introduction to the key subject matter of plastics and the environment; the second explores several pertinent applications of plastics with environmental implications-packaging, paints and coatings, textiles, and agricultural film use. The third section discusses the behavior of plastics in some of the environments in which they are typically used, such as the outdoors, in biotic environments, or in fires. The final section consists of chapters on recycling and thermal treatment of plastics waste. Chapters include: * Commodity Polymers * Plastics in Transportation * Biodegradation of Common Polymers * Thermal Treatment of Polymer Waste * Incineration of Plastics The contributors also focus on the effectiveness of recent technologies in mitigating environmental impacts, particularly those for managing plastics in the solid waste stream. Plastic and design engineers, polymer chemists, material scientists, and ecologists will find Plastics and the Environment to be a vital resource to this critical industry.},

The objective of this study was to grow dry beans over two consecutive growing seasons using the same plastic mulch of different colors and examine the influence of soil temperature on growth and yield. The experiment was conducted in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, in the spring and summer of 2008. The treatments included four colored plastic mulches: white-on-black, black, silver-on-black, aluminum-on-black, and bare soil as a control. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates. The percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reflected from the plastic tended to be highest with the white-on-black mulch and lowest with the black mulch. Mean soil temperature under the plastic mulch decreased with the increasing percentage of reflected PAR. Mean soil temperature exhibited a relationship of 98\% and 99\% to yield in the first and second growing season, respectively. Photosynthetically active radiation had a relationship of 98\% and 86\% to yield in the first and second growing season, respectively. The effect of the colored plastic mulch on yield was significant (p ≤ 0.05) in the first growing season but not in the second, where plastic mulch and bare soil treatments had similar yields, indicating that plastic mulches do not always increase yield.},

A first important step to assess the consequences of plastic debris in aquatic ecosystems is the establishment of a reliable, verified, and standardized method to quantify the amount of plastic particles in the environment. We improved the density separation approach by the construction of the so called Munich Plastic Sediment Separator (MPSS). It enables a reliable separation of different ecologically relevant size classes of plastic particles from sediment samples. A ZnCl2-solution (1.6–1.7 kg/L) as separation fluid allows for an extraction of plastic particles ranging from large fragments to small microplastic particles (S-MPP, {$<$}1 mm). Subsequent identification and quantification of the particles with spatial resolution down to 1 µm can be performed using Raman microspectroscopy. Our study is the first providing validated recovery rates of 100\% for large microplastic particles (L-MPP, 1–5 mm) and 95.5\% for S-MPP. The recovery rate for S-MPP, using the MPSS, was significantly higher than the value obtained by application of classical density separation setup (39.8\%). Moreover, our recovery rates were significantly higher than those based on froth flotation (55.0\% for L-MPP) commonly used in recycling industries. Hence, our improved method can be used for a reliable and time-efficient separation, identification and quantification of plastic fragments down to S-MPP. This will help foster studies quantifying the increasing contamination of aquatic environments with microplastic particles, which is a crucial prerequisite for future risk assessment and management strategies.},

Their coloration is gained by the addition of pigments to the polymer blend which is the major component of the respective product. However, color is also a feature of paint and coatings whereby the pigment is the major component. Once abraded from a surface, paint particles may enter the environment via similar pathways as microplastic particles. So far no detailed studies of microplastic particles (pigmented and non-pigmented) as well as paint particles have been performed focusing on very small microparticles (1-50 gm), in either marine or limnetic ecosystems. Using Raman microspectroscopy with a spatial resolution down to 1 pm, we report a remarkable increase in the occurrence of (pigmented) microplastic particles below 500 gm. Among those, most particles were found at a size of 130 gm in a freshwater ecosystem (subalpine Lake Garda, Italy). Moreover, our qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the number of paint microparticles significantly increased below the size range of 50 pm due to their brittleness (the smallest detected paint particle had a size of 4 gm). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements showed that both colored particles found in nature as well as virgin particles contain a high variety of metals such as cadmium, lead and copper. These additives may elicit adverse effects in biota ingesting these microparticles, thus paints and associated compounds may act as formerly overlooked contaminants in freshwater ecosystems.

We report results from the water-scarce region of Minqin County, where 87\% of Chinese farmers interviewed responded that they use plastic mulch to conserve water and 53\% to increase yields. Survey results indicated the desire to conserve water through the use of plastic mulch to be statistically equivalent to the desire to increase yields.

  abstract = {China’s Minqin Oasis once welcomed traders along the ancient Silk Road with rivers, lakes, and lush forests, yet today the region’s farmland and grassland are increasingly being engulfed by the sands of the Gobi Desert. The severity of this incremental catastrophe for a declining population of 300,000 residents has brought forth a host of recent water policies to include agronomic water conservation through plastic mulch use, computerized regulation and pricing of groundwater, and water diversions from the Yellow River. This study uses a multi-disciplinary and mixed methods approach to better understand farmer perspectives on why they implement certain water and land use practices in agriculture. The world’s farmers currently use the majority of the world’s available freshwater and arable land. Modern agriculture and its continued intensification also lead to increases in petroleum based inputs such as agrochemicals and agricultural plastics (plasticulture). Despite the large of impact of the decisions made by the world’s farmers on natural resources, little research to date has sought to better understand farmers’ perceptions and decision-making processes. Plastic film mulch is a technology that has existed since the 1940’s and it has been used in places such as rural China for over five decades. This technology conserves a considerable amount of irrigation water and it increases harvests, however, use of plastic for mulch causes waste disposal problems and is an expenditure of petroleum through plastic manufacturing. Without a fundamental understanding of why farmers perceive plastic mulch to be valuable to their households and communities, we may not fully grasp why its global application continues to increase year after year. Moreover, a focused study of plastic mulch use at the local level may also allow researchers and entrepreneurs to develop a suitable alternative mulch that does not consume non-renewable resources or result in detrimental plastic waste after its utility has been exhausted. This study uses household level interviews, surveys, and participant observation to better understand why Minqin County farmers in rural China continue to use plastic mulch and how it may influence their standard of living.},

Contributions of individual components to production efficiency, cost, and environmental impact have been a focus of such research. Public awareness of the environmental impact of products and services is increasing. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool to study horticultural crop production systems and horticultural services and their individual components on environmental impacts such as the carbon footprint, stated as global warming potential. This manuscript introduces LCA and describes how this tool can be used to generate information important to the industry and consuming public.},

  abstract = {A mixture of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene-terephtalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and Nylon was submerged in marine water during 12 moths. The chlorine content of these plastics was measured through the passing time. Thermobalance was used to look for differences in the thermal decomposition of the plastics during in that time interval. Degradation of PET, PP and Nylon produced changes in the weight loss curve, but behaviour of PE is confusing. Pyrolysis and combustion at 850 °C was finally performed to get knowledge of the possible differences in the emission of main gases, volatiles and semivolatiles including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated benzenes (ClBzs), polychlorinated phenols (ClPhs), polybrominated phenols (BrPhs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Results show that the emission of chlorinated species is somewhat not affected by the chlorine content of the plastics mix. The production of PCBs and PCDD/Fs was very low, under 4 pg WHO-TEQ/g.},

In the present study, polyethylene terephthalate bottles (PETs) collected from the submarine environment were characterized using ATR-FTIR in respect to their degradation potential attributed to environmental conditions. A temporal indication was used as indicative to the years of presence of the PETs in the environment as debris. PETs seem to remain robust for approximately fifteen years. Afterwards, a significant decrease of the native functional groups was recorded; some even disappear; or new-not typical for PETs-are created. At a later stage, using the PET time series collected from the Saronikos Gulf (Aegean Sea-E. Mediterranean), it was possible to date bottles that were collected from the bottom of the Ionian Sea (W.

  abstract = {Thirty soil samples were collected from fields that have been used for cultivating watermelons and canning tomatoes for over 10 years. The microplastics (MPs) within these samples were separated with a density floatation method and the use of sieves and filters. The microplastics found were black and originated from the black agricultural mulch film (BMF) used in these cultivations. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed that these microplastics are of the same material as the virgin BMF and as a virgin polyethylene film used as blank. SEM images showed that used BMF and MPs found in soil were oxidized by their exposure to sunlight and create fibrous edges that lead to the creation of smaller size MPs. The number of MPs found in fields with watermelon (301 ± 140 items kg−1) were more than four times higher than in fields with canning tomatoes (69 ± 38 items kg−1) due to the double planting each year and to the second planting last year being closer to the sampling episode. All the sample sites were collected from agricultural fields away from the industrial area; therefore, these results prove that agricultural activities might have caused contamination of soils with MPs. This is corroborated even more by the fact that no MPs were found in five extra samples that were taken from uncultivated areas as blanks.},

These tiny plastic particles are found in the environment all around the globe as well as in drinking water and food, raising concerns about their impacts on the environment and human health. To adequately address these issues, reliable information on the ambient concentrations of microplastics and nanoplastics is needed. However, micro- and nanoplastic particles are extremely complex and diverse in terms of their size, shape, density, polymer type, surface properties, etc. While the particle concentrations in different media can vary by up to 10 orders of magnitude, analysis of such complex samples may resemble searching for a needle in a haystack. This highlights the critical importance of appropriate methods for the chemical identification, quantification, and characterization of microplastics and nanoplastics. The present article reviews advanced methods for the representative mass-based and particle-based analysis of microplastics, with a focus on the sensitivity and lower-size limit for detection. The advantages and limitations of the methods, and their complementarity for the comprehensive characterization of microplastics are discussed. A special attention is paid to the approaches for reliable analysis of nanoplastics. Finally, an outlook for establishing harmonized and standardized methods to analyze these challenging contaminants is presented, and perspectives within and beyond this research field are discussed.},

Finally, we identify knowledge gaps, suggest possible strategies to assess environmental risks arising from MP, and discuss prospects to minimize MP abundance in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Water-saving rice production systems are inevitable in the wake of severe water shortage in rice-growing regions of the world. Mulches can improve water productivity, yield and quality of rice through increase in water retention. Studies were conducted for two consecutive years to assess the potential role of mulches (plastic and straw) in improving the performance of water-saving rice production systems in comparison with no mulch used and conventionally irrigated transplanted rice. Water-saving rice production systems in this study comprise aerobic rice and transplanted rice with intermittent irrigation. These systems saved water (18–27~\%) with improved water productivity more than the conventional system. However, these systems caused a yield penalty of 22–37~\%; nevertheless, these yield losses were compensated with the application of mulches under water-saving rice production systems. Both plastic and straw mulches were helpful in improving moisture retention and water productivity (0.18–0.25~kg grain m−3 water) relative to non-mulch treatments (0.19–0.29~kg grain m−3 water). Mulch application was also helpful in reducing the number of non-productive tillers and sterile spikelets, and improving the productive tillers, kernel number and size, and kernel quality. Plastic mulch was more effective than straw mulch in improving water retention, water productivity and reducing spikelet sterility. In conclusion, the mulching improved the soil moisture retention, and thus enhanced the rice water productivity, spikelet fertility, paddy yield and quality of rice. This signifies the importance of mulching in water-saving rice production systems.},

  abstract = {Plastics have a variety of applications due to their versatility, relative cost, and strength-to-weight ratio, and resistance to degradation. As a result, plastic waste can be found in all corners of the Earth. A class of plastic contaminants that have received increasing attention in terms of their potential impact on ecosystems is microplastics (≤5~mm). The greatest attention to date has been on their potential effect in marine ecosystems. However, a growing number of studies are examining their potential impact on soil ecosystems. The data reported in the literature on the environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soils and the concentration of microplastics that causes an adverse effect in soil biota were used to perform a probabilistic risk assessment of microplastics to soil biota. An environmental exposure distribution was constructed from the concentrations of microplastics reported in soil in the literature. Species sensitivity distributions were constructed using concentration of microplastics in soil that had no adverse effect on soil species (NOEC) or the lowest concentrations that had an adverse effect on soil species (LOEC) reported in the literature. The 95th centile of the environmental exposure distribution (8147 microplastic particles per gram of soil) was greater than 22 and 28\% of the species sensitivity distribution constructed using NOECs and LOECs, respectively. The assessment concluded that environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics reported in the literature could pose a considerable risk to soil biota. It is also important to note that due to the continued production of large quantities of plastic and the persistence of microplastics in the environment, environmentally-relevant concentrations of microplastics in soil are likely to only rise.},

Plastic is a planetary boundary threat if it is having a currently unrecognized disruptive effect on a vital Earth system process. Discovering possible unknown effects is likely to be aided by achieving a fuller understanding of the environmental fate of plastic. Weathering of plastic generates microplastic, releases chemical additives, and likely also produces nanoplastic and chemical fragments cleaved from the polymer backbone. However, weathering of plastic in the marine environment is not well understood in terms of time scales for fragmentation and degradation, the evolution of particle morphology and properties, and hazards of the chemical mixture liberated by weathering. Biofilms that form and grow on plastic affect weathering, vertical transport, toxicity, and uptake of plastic by marine organisms and have been underinvestigated. Laboratory studies, field monitoring, and models of the impact of weathering on plastic debris are needed to reduce uncertainty in hazard and risk assessments for known and suspected adverse effects. However, scientists and decision makers must also recognize that plastic in the oceans may have unanticipated effects about which we are currently ignorant. Possible impacts that are currently unknown can be confronted by vigilant monitoring of plastic in the oceans and discovery-oriented research related to the possible effects of weathering plastic.},

Decabromodiphenyl ether (Br10-DPE) and decabromodibenzyl (Br10-DB) were used as flame retardants and two samples contained antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) synergist besides the brominated additives. The thermal decomposition of HIPS samples was studied by thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (Py-MS). It was established that the brominated additives themselves do not change the decomposition temperature of polystyrene (PS). However, Sb2O3 reduces the thermal stability of the samples indicating that Sb2O3 initiates the decomposition of the flame retardants and PS. Water and styrene products were detected during the first stage of decomposition from HIPS samples containing Sb2O3. Nevertheless, the majority of PS decomposes at a higher temperature. The two brominated flame retardants decompose by different pathways. The scission of C Ã/C bonds, resulting in the formation of bromotoluenes, is the most important reaction of Br10-DB additives. In contrast, Br10-DPE decomposes by an intermolecular ring closure pathway producing brominated dibenzofurans (DBF).},

In addition, EOs have a broad range of applications in foods, perfumes, cosmetics and human nutrition. Among different techniques for analysis of EOs, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is the most important one in recent years. However, there are some fundamental problems in GC–MS analysis including baseline drift, spectral background, noise, low S/N (signal to noise) ratio, changes in the peak shapes and co-elution. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) approaches cope with ongoing challenges and are able to handle these problems. This review focuses on the application of MCR techniques for improving GC–MS analysis of EOs published between January 2000 and December 2010. In the first part, the importance of EOs in human life and their relevance in analytical chemistry is discussed. In the second part, an insight into some basics needed to understand prospects and limitations of the MCR techniques are given. In the third part, the significance of the combination of the MCR approaches with GC–MS analysis of EOs is highlighted. Furthermore, the commonly used algorithms for preprocessing, chemical rank determination, local rank analysis and multivariate resolution in the field of EOs analysis are reviewed.},

The objective of our study was to determine the influence of agronomic variables on soil LF content, and to evaluate the LF as a measure of labile organic matter. Soils from three long-term crop rotation studies in Saskatchewan, Canada, were analyzed for LF content and composition. The experiments, established at Indian Head (Udic Boroll), Melfort (Udic Boroll), and Scott (Typic Boroll), included wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based rotations varying in fertilizer application, frequency of summer fallow, and cropping sequence. The LF of the surface soil (0–7.5 cm) accounted for 2.0 to 5.4\%, 3.3 to 7.1\%, and 7.1 to 17.5\% of the organic C at Indian Head, Melfort, and Scott, respectively. Within each site, the LF content was generally highest in treatments with continuous cropping or perennial forages and lowest in those with a high frequency of summer fallow. Fertilizer application generally favored LF accumulation. Differences in LF content among sites and treatments were attributed to variable residue inputs and rates of substrate decomposition. The respiration rate and microbial N content of soils was strongly correlated with the LF content, suggesting that the LF is a useful indicator of labile organic matter. Nitrogen mineralization was also correlated with LF content, though the relationship was less consistent, presumably because the high C/N ratio of the LF induced temporary N immobilization. The LF content is a sensitive indicator of the effects of cropping on soil organic matter content and composition but, because of its transient nature, probably reflects primarily short-term effects.},

The main conclusion of this study is that the effect of climate on soil water repellency is very limited. Field observations in the arid Middle Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico (USA) and the humid Piedras Blancas Watershed in Colombia show that the main impact of climate seems to be in which manner it affects the production of organic matter. An extremely dry climate will result in low organic matter production rates and, therefore, less potential for the development of soil water repellency. On the other hand, a very humid climate is favorable for organic matter production and, therefore, for the development of water repellency.},

Thetemperature wave amplitudes ranged from 17.9 to 21.0°C. Potassium chloride solution was used tomoisten Clarinda clay and Fayette silty clay loamsoils. Initial water contents of 0.403 and 0.279 andinitial solute concentrations of 0.062 and 0.052 mol kg-1were used in Clarinda and Fayette soils,respectively. The moistened soils were packed andcompacted in PVC columns (0.075 m diameter and 0.30 mhigh). Bulk densities of the compacted Clarinda andFayette soils were 1403 and 1585 kg m-3,respectively. The columns were buried in soil suchthat column surfaces were exposed to natural as wellas artificial radiation and thermal conditions. Thecoupled nonsteady-state balance equations of mass andenergy were solved numerically to predict soiltemperature, water content, and solute concentrationdistributions. The theoretical model described soiltemperature, water content, and solute concentrationwell as compared with the measured values. TheFickian diffusive solute flux was one or two orders ofmagnitude greater than salt-sieving and thermal-diffusion solute fluxes.},

  abstract = {Various types of clear or tinted, perforated plastic films are increasingly used as crop row covers in production of numerous fruit and vegetable crops (Rickard 1979). In temperate climates the modified environment under these covers permits earlier planting and promotes early-season growth but it also favors aggressive weed growth necessitating the use of herbicides. DCPA (dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, tradename Dacthal) is a post-plant, soil-applled herbicide that is widely used in many horticultural crops. DCPA is acknowledged as being strongly adsorbed to soll organic matter and essentially immobile in soll (Helling et al. 1971). It is degraded by soll microorganisms (Tweedy et al. 1968) and is not being appreciably affected by photodecomposition or volatilization (Weed Scl. Soc. Amer. 1983). However, recent studies have reported significant volatilization losses of DCPA following soll surface applications in the field (Glotfelty et al. 1984). Plastic row covers promote plant growth by maintaining increased temperature, humidity, C02, and higher levels of soll moisture (Rickard 1979). Some of these factors are likewise known to influence DCPA dissipation in soils (Glotfelty et al. 1984, Horowitz et al. 1974, Walker 1978). The purpose of this investigation was to determine how the use of several types of plastic row covers influenced residues of DCPA in soils and crops. Broccoli was used as a test crop because of the relatively short interval of time between herbicide application and harvest.},

Effects of DEHP and DBP were also tested on newly hatched collembolans in a multidish system. The endpoints were juvenile mortality, growth, and development. When exposed to DEHP, adults and juveniles were unaffected at all test concentrations, that is, up to 5,000 mg/kg. However, DBP caused increased adult mortality at 250 mg/kg and juvenile mortality at 25 mg/kg. For DBP, adult reproduction was a more sensitive endpoint than was survival, with an EC10 and EC50 of 14 and 68 mg/kg, respectively. Juvenile molting frequency seems to be a sensitive parameter, because number of cuticles produced by young springtails was reduced at 1 mg/kg. Toxicity was reduced when soil spiked with DBP was stored at 20°C for a period of up to 28 d before adding the animals. Reduction in toxicity of DBP may be due a combination of degradation, evaporation, and adsorption of DBP to soil material. This was confirmed by chemical analyses, which showed a rapid initial disappearance followed by a much slower disappearance. Our results lead to the overall conclusion that significant adverse effects of phthalates on collembolans are not likely to occur as a result of normal sewage sludge application.},

  abstract = {We explore the dynamics of soil organic carbon of various forms and its relation with soil fertility in seeded alfalfa grassland established using a field micro-catchment technique to harvest water on the semiarid Loess Plateau in China. Five regimes were set up: (1) conventional flat cultivation without mulch (CK), (2) ridges and furrows were set up alternately on flat land, with 15 cm between each so that the distance between successive ridges (or successive furrows) was 30 cm, and the ridges were mulched with plastic film (M30), (3) similar to M30, but with twice the distance between furrows and ridges (M60), (4) similar to M30, but the ridges were not mulched (B30), (5) similar to M60, but the ridges were not mulched (B60). The increase in alfalfa forage yield in the mulch regimes promotes soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the light fraction of organic carbon (LFOC), the heavy fraction of organic carbon (HFOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). MBC was significantly higher in M30 and M60 than in the other regimes. Significant positive correlation is found between MBC and LFOC (R=0.89; P{$<$}0.0001), and MBC and HFOC (R=0.82; P=0.00016). At the end of our three-year experiment, the C/N ratio of 10.09 in M60 was significantly (P{$<$}0.005) higher than the other regimes. Since a lower C/N ratio accelerates SOC decomposition in this region, the higher C/N ratio in M60 could limit mineralization of soil nitrogen, conserving soil nitrogen and SOC. The lower ratio of nitrate and nitrite nitrogen to total nitrogen, of 10.74, in M60 at the end of this experiment than in the other regimes and before sowing supports this point. The correlations of SOC with available P and with the ratio of available P to total P are positive in the dry year of 2001, but negative in the wet year of 2002. This can be explained on the basis that a high forage yield of alfalfa requires more soil available P in the wet years than in the dry years.},

  abstract = {The impact of nanometer-scale plastics ({$<$}1000 nm nanoplastics, NPs) on the bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic pollutants, and especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in marine organisms has become of urgent concern. However, simultaneous determinations of the bioaccumulation of NPs and PAHs have been hindered by the lack of an efficient digestion method that removes background interference from the tissue without altering the surface properties of the plastic and destroying the PAHs. To solve this problem, an enzymatic digestion-based protocol using proteinase K and subsequent quantification methods were developed on a typical marine benthic invertebrate – the clamworm Perinereis aibuhitensis. Enzymatic digestion removed 91\% of the biological tissues, comparable to the amount removed using 65\% HNO3 (93\% removed) and better than that removed using 30\% H2O2 or 10\% KOH digestion (76\% and 66\%, respectively). After enzymatic digestion, roughly 92\% of the NPs and 88\% of the amount of pyrene were recovered, without significant modification of the NPs or pyrene degradation. By contrast, the NP and pyrene recovery achieved with HNO3 digestion was only 1.4\% and 0.1\%, respectively. The newly developed protocol was successfully applied to a 96-h bioaccumulation study. The use of radioactively labeled 14C-pyrene and fluorescently labeled NPs allowed the simultaneous quantification of NPs and PAHs in the clamworm and revealed a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 1.96 ± 0.93 and 402.7 ± 47.0, respectively. The quantification of NPs and pyrene indicated that NP-adsorbed pyrene accounted for {$<$}1\% of the total pyrene accumulation in the clamworm body when the concentration of NPs in seawater was as low as 0.4 mg/L. Our enzymatic digestion and dual-labeling technique thus provides the first reported BCF value of NPs in a marine benthic organism and new insights into the vector effects of these particles on the bioaccumulation of organic contaminants in a marine ecosystem.},

Their persistence, wide distribution and constant accumulation in the environment are the main causes of their current classification as contaminants. Apart from the known effects that they may have on organisms (which clearly depend on their size) and their tendency to leach some of their components, especially additives, an important concern has also arisen in the last years as a result of their capability of retaining onto their surface organic contaminants of a wide nature. In this regard, it is worth highlighting the adsorption of persistent organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, or organochlorine pesticides, among others. This review article pretends to provide a critical, updated, and general vision of the current analytical methods that have been developed so far (period covered between 2001 and 2020) for the analysis of organic contaminants present in microplastics found in the environment, including their occurrence. The analysis of the published literature clearly indicates that most of the methods applied up to now are relatively complex and that their analysis is also nowadays a challenge, as a result of the wide variability in the composition, sizes, and shapes of microplastics.},

  abstract = {In this review, we examine how roots penetrate a structured soil. We first examine the relationship between soil water status and its mechanical strength, as well as the ability of the soil to supply water to the root. We identify these as critical soil factors, because it is primarily in drying soil that mechanical constraints limit root elongation. Water supply to the root is important because root water status affects growth pressures and root stiffness. To simplify the bewildering complexity of soil–root interactions, the discussion is focused around the special cases of root elongation in soil with pores much smaller than the root diameter and the penetration of roots at interfaces within the soil. While it is often assumed that the former case is well understood, many unanswered questions remain. While low soil–root friction is often viewed as a trait conferring better penetration of strong soils, it may also increase the axial pressure on the root tip and in so doing reduce the rate of cell division and/or expansion. The precise trade-off between various root traits involved in root elongation in homogeneous soil remains to be determined. There is consensus that the most important factors determining root penetration at an interface are the angle at which the root attempts to penetrate the soil, root stiffness, and the strength of the soil to be penetrated. The effect of growth angle on root penetration implicates gravitropic responses in improved root penetration ability. Although there is no work that has explored the effect of the strength of the gravitropic responses on penetration of hard layers, we attempt to outline possible interactions. Impacts of soil drying and strength on phytohormone concentrations in roots, and consequent root-to-shoot signalling, are also considered.},

Excellent stability of slurry film was credited to its PEDOT-rich core, Poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS)-rich shell structure, and high molecular weight (Mw) PSS dopant while the degradation of in-situ PEDOT was attributed to oxidation by oxygen in air. Thermal analysis data supported this hypothesis. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that C=C bond breaking and decreased doping level were responsible for poor stability of in-situ film in air.},

Black plastic mulch controls most weeds; however, black mulch often does not warm the soil as well as clear mulch. Soil warming with clear mulch is desirable for early season markets, but clear mulch does not control weeds. Neither black nor clear mulches combine the ideal weed control and soil warming characteristics required. Seven colored mulches, as well as clear, black and no mulch were evaluated in California organic and conventional strawberries to identify mulch factors associated with weed control and soil warming. Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were also conducted to isolate the effects of light transmittance through mulch on weed germination and growth. The effect of mulch color on transmittance of photosynthetically active light (400 to 700 nm) through mulches was the key weed control factor, and was more important than the effect of mulch color effect on weed germination. Satisfactory weed control was provided by all mulches except clear, blue and red-brown laminated. Clear and black mulches provided the greatest soil warming in sunny and cloudy climatic conditions, respectively, although plants in clear mulched conventional production system plots produced the highest yield of marketable berries. Green and brown plastic mulches provided the best combinations of soil warming and weed control benefits at all trial locations.},

Adverse effects of MPs on aquatic organisms have been widely studied, whereas little research has focused on soil invertebrates. We exposed the soil springtail Folsomia candida to artificial soils contaminated with polyethylene MPs ({$<$}500 μm) for 28 d to explore the effects of MPs on avoidance, reproduction, and gut microbiota. Springtails exhibited avoidance behaviors at 0.5\% and 1\% MPs (w/w in dry soil), and the avoidance rate was 59\% and 69\%, respectively. Reproduction was inhibited when the concentration of MPs reached 0.1\% and was reduced by 70.2\% at the highest concentration of 1\% MPs compared to control. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value based on reproduction for F.~candida was 0.29\% MPs. At concentrations of 0.5\% dry weight in the soil, MPs significantly altered the microbial community and decreased bacterial diversity in the springtail gut. Specifically, the relative abundance of Wolbachia significantly decreased while the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobiaceae, Ensifer and Stenotrophomonas significantly increased. Our results demonstrated that MPs exerted a significant toxic effect on springtails and can change their gut microbial community. This can provide useful information for risk assessment of MPs in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Soil MPs exceeding a certain concentration cause significant harm. Therefore, the extraction and identification of MPs in soil are vital for determining soil pollution. However, soils contain many other particles of similar size to MPs/NPs, making it more difficult to distinguish them than in water bodies. No standardized extraction and identification method is available to quantify MPs/NPs in soil. Various methods have been described in the literature, but they involve many different procedures for sampling, purification, digestion, and identification. This paper reviews extraction and identification methods for MPs/NPs in soil, sediment, and water and summarizes agricultural soil sampling and preservation, MPs/NPs separation, organic matter removal, and MPs/NPs identification.

  abstract = {The visual nature of plastic pollution and the scandals of plastic waste exports to developing countries have prompted a shift in how plastics are made, used, and disposed. Plastic waste remains poorly managed, with as much as 12,000 million tonnes projected to have accumulated in landfills or the natural environment by 2050 ([ 1 ][1]). Although mechanical recycling was initially promoted as the solution to rising amounts of postconsumer plastic waste, its failure over the past decades has exposed the severity and scale of the plastic waste management crisis. In light of this, the recovery of plastics through chemical recycling—polymer recycling into their constituting repeat units or monomers (and oligomers)—and the development of bio-based and biodegradable alternatives have gained increasing attention. We consider the technical, chemical, and biological routes to closing the loop and argue for an integrated plastic waste management system rooted in the circular bioeconomy. Shunning fossil-based plastics has provided a fertile ground for the emergence of alternative materials, loosely referred to as “bioplastics.” Despite favorable public opinion, consumer awareness and understanding of the subtleties in the terminology is poor ([ 2 ][2]). The term bioplastics is an umbrella designation that captures a range of polymer chemistries, properties, and application sectors. It encompasses two distinct concepts: the bio-based origin of the raw materials and biodegradability at the end of life. Bio-based sources are necessary for divesting from fossil fuels. However, life-cycle analyses have uncovered complexities in the system, mostly owing to agricultural inputs for bioplastic feedstock production ([ 3 ][3]). Recent approaches using waste or coproducts from the biomass sector as feedstocks offer attractive alternatives. Some (fully or partly) bio-based plastics, such as bio-polyethylene terephthalate (bio-PET), are chemically identical to their fossil-based counterpart, making them suitable for the current recycling infrastructure. However, biodegradability tends to be perceived as more sustainable over (mechanical) recyclability by consumers ([ 2 ][2]). The biggest advantage of biodegradable plastics may not be their biodegradability per se but their compatibility with food waste, opening new streams for plastic waste management positioned around organics recycling ([ 3 ][3]). Nevertheless, issues associated with separation and contamination in existing mechanical recycling streams and concerns over their complete biodegradability in the current organic waste management infrastructure remain ([ 4 ][4]). Although biodegradable plastics can return carbon and nutrients to the soil, the energy and resources associated with their production is effectively lost, echoing the linear flow of petrochemical plastics in single-use applications. Maintaining a closed-loop resource flow appears more sustainable. Yet, 67\% of plastic waste generated in the UK consists of hard-to-recycle packaging ([ 6 ][5]). Across Europe, only 42\% of plastic waste generated is collected for recycling ([ 5 ][6], [ 6 ][5]). Failing market incentives for plastic recyclate have led to many plastics being exported to Southeast Asia, where they are often disposed of in illegal landfills ([ 7 ][7]). Thermochemical processes, such as pyrolysis and gasification, have emerged as an alternative recycling strategy for the recovery of plastic waste—notably, hard-to-recycle plastics ([ 6 ][5]). Although they are often referred to as chemical recycling, these processes are not selective for monomer retrieval, producing a wide range of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide (CO2). Further separation and transformation steps are required that are energy intensive. By contrast, closed-loop recycling to monomers (CRM) can be seen as ultimate chemical recycling in that it ensures the recovery of a given polymer's building blocks. The feasibility of CRM is greatly dependent on polymerization-depolymerization thermodynamics ([ 8 ][8]). The most prevalent feature of such polymers is a hydrolyzable functionality in the polymer backbone, such as ester, amide, and carbonate linkages. PET, the most widely mechanically recycled commodity plastic, falls under this category. Polyolefins, such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), pose a challenge for CRM because of their carbon-to-carbon backbone. The introduction of functional groups as break points in a PE chain presents an opportunity to address polyolefin-like polymers with potential for CRM while retaining the desired material properties, as has been demonstrated ([ 9 ][9]). Although challenges remain in this strategy, these technological advances could ensure that monomers are effectively recovered, preventing the issue of downgrading or downcycling, seen with mechanical recycling. ![Figure][10]{$<$}/img{$>$} Closing the plastics loop Plastics (polymers) could be designed so that the monomers they are built from can be retrieved. Some plastics can also biodegrade for certain niche applications or when environmental leakage occurs. Monomers may be feedstocks for synthesizing added-value products such as surfactants or new polymers or turned back to their original polymer. Enzymatic or chemical catalysis can prevent property deterioration from this process. GRAPHIC: N. CARY/ SCIENCE  Nevertheless, a sustainable plastics value chain extends beyond monomer recovery. The accumulation of plastic waste points toward a design flaw in the plastics value chain and the need to think systemically about closing the loop of the circular economy. If resources are cheap, the impetus to produce single-use products from virgin materials is high. Suspending trade of low-quality plastic waste from developed to developing countries and introducing taxes on fossil resources can encourage the substitution of raw resources with recycled materials and investment in waste management infrastructure ([ 7 ][7], [ 10 ][11]). Although these measures may increase the value of recycled polymers, the quality of recycled materials will remain a substantial challenge, especially for plastic packaging. In the context of a circular economy, the value of durable plastics needs to be recognized, but in conjunction with modularity in polymer and product design. Yet, there seems to be a lack of directionality around plastics-focused policies. If left uncoordinated, the promotion of biodegradable plastics within a bioeconomy framework on one side and of closed-loop recycling from a circular economy perspective on the other may lead to conflicting priorities. The distinction between biodegradable and recyclable plastics suggests that biological and chemical routes to plastic waste management cannot be merged, perhaps misleadingly so. Most biodegradable plastics are or could be chemically recyclable because they can be fully metabolized by naturally occurring microorganisms. Developing a system in which plastics are designed for both chemical recycling and biodegradation is not only sensible but helps to overcome the artificial dichotomy emerging from current policies (see the figure). Thus, a waste management infrastructure for plastics to be collected and recycled should be prioritized while also fulfilling an end of life in applications for which biodegradability is needed. Chemical polymer manufacturing and recycling is already technically feasible, cost effective, and scalable. But, development of the chemistry to design out recalcitrant petrochemicals and improve recycling efficiency is still needed. These challenges should be supported with a combined push in both chemistry and biotechnology. More recently, enzymatic hydrolysis of polymers has emerged as a potential bioremediation strategy ([ 11 ][12]). Enzymatic recycling has been demonstrated for PET ([ 12 ][13], [ 13 ][14]), with the need for other enzymes for metabolizing a greater range of polymers. Obtaining monomers from CO2 fixation would ultimately decouple production from raw materials ([ 13 ][14]). The consideration of alternative waste treatment strategies for plastic waste is undoubtedly only part of the bigger issue of a linear economic model. The fallacy of mechanical recycling has already taught us that technology alone will not and cannot solve the plastic pollution crisis. No silver-bullet solution exists for the multifaceted nature of plastic pollution. The answer instead lies in a blend of approaches. Pre- and postconsumer stages need to be more aligned, from a strong regulatory framework and the investment in effective waste collection and management infrastructure to the development of polymer chemistries, life-cycle design, and consumer behavior. Only through committed action and coordination across the value chain will a sustainable future for plastics be secured. 1.  [↵][15]1.   R. Geyer et al          ., Sci.

It was identified and determined in gallstones by thermal analysis technique (DSC and TG-DTA), mainly by the use of the melting temperature (Tonset=145°C and Tmax=149°C) and by DTG peak decomposition (Tmax=364°C). Cholesterol anhydrous (ChA), which showed endothermic polymorphic peak, Tmax=40°C, without mass loss, was differentiated from cholesterol monohydrate (ChH), which showed a broad endothermic peak, Tmax=59°C, attributed to loss of water of crystallization (theoretical 4.45\%). Morphological studies of gallstones were performed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The stones consisted of a pigmented core with a variably-sized irregular central cavity, surrounded by a radially arranged deposits of plate-like ChH. The outer part of the stones showed ChA crystal arborescences. X-ray microanalysis gave a typical spectrum rich in C and O, and in some instances the presence of P, which was attributed to the presence of phospholipids. CaCO3 was easily characterized by TG with the use of DTG decomposition peak at 674°C.},

We studied the toxicity of diethyl phthalate (DEP), spiked in a compost plant growth substrate, by means of the acute toxicity Flash test and on the basis of the germination and plant growth of radish seedlings. The response of the microbial community to DEP in the growth substrate was studied by PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). In the acute toxicity test, DEP was found to be less toxic as a pure compound than when mixed with the compost mixture. This suggests the synergistic effect of unknown toxic compounds or the release of compounds due to DEP addition. The same DEP concentration level in compost substrate induced toxic response in both plant test and microbial community analysis. The diversity of the major microbial community was reduced from a broad community to only 10 major species at toxic concentrations of DEP.

The lifetime of the biodegradable mulches was 9 months and of the biodegradable low-tunnel films 6 months. The radiometric properties of the biodegradable films influenced positively the microclimate: air temperature under the biodegradable low tunnel films was 2 °C higher than under the low density polyethylene films, resulting in an up to 20\% higher yield of strawberries. At the end of the cultivation period, the biodegradable mulches were broken up and buried in the field soil together with the plant residues. One year after burial, less than 4\% of the initial weight of the biodegradable film was found in the soil. According to ecotoxicity tests, the kinetic luminescent bacteria test with Vibrio fischeri and the Enchytraeus albidus ISO/CD 16387 reproduction potential, there was no evidence of ecotoxicity in the soil during the biodegradation process. Furthermore, there was no change in the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the soil determined on the basis of the appearance of amoA gene diversity in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many studies on the analysis of microplastics (MP) in environmental samples have been published. These studies are hardly comparable due to different sampling, sample preparation, as well as identification and quantification techniques. Here, MP identification is one of the crucial pitfalls. Visual identification approaches using morphological criteria alone often lead to significant errors, being especially true for MP fibers. Reliable, chemical structure-based identification methods are indispensable. In this context, the frequently used vibrational spectroscopic techniques but also thermoanalytical methods are established. However, no critical comparison of these fundamentally different approaches has ever been carried out with regard to analyzing MP in environmental samples. In this blind study, we investigated 27 single MP particles and fibers of unknown material isolated from river sediments. Successively micro-attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (μ-ATR-FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GCMS) in combination with thermochemolysis were applied. Both methods differentiated between plastic vs. non-plastic in the same way in 26 cases, with 19 particles and fibers (22 after re-evaluation) identified as the same polymer type. To illustrate the different approaches and emphasize the complementarity of their information content, we exemplarily provide a detailed comparison of four particles and three fibers and a critical discussion of advantages and disadvantages of both methods.},

The main purpose of the study was to determine the effects of mulch practices (a control--unmulched treatment, a plastic mulch treatment, and a straw mulch treatment) on fresh ear yield and some yield-related traits of sweet corn according to 3 sowing dates: 1 April, 15 April, and 1 May, respectively. The main effects of sowing dates were significant for the harvest period, the emerging rate from soil, the fresh ear yield per hectare, and the yield components of the sweet corn. The emergence rate of sweet corn was decreased on 1 April and 15 April due to the low soil temperature on these sowing dates. Of the mulch practices, the plastic mulch practice resulted in the highest emergence rate, the highest ear length, the highest ear diameter, the highest ear weight, the highest number of kernels per ear, the highest fresh ear yield, and the highest fresh ear number in both 2010 and 2011. The fresh ear yield and yield components were decreased by the straw mulch practice in both 2010 and 2011. The effects of the sowing date x mulch practice interactions on emergence rate, fresh ear yield, and some yield-related traits of sweet corn were statistically (P {$<$} 0.05 and P {$<$} 0.01) significant in both years. Of the interactions between the sowing dates and the mulch practices, the highest emergence rate (91.2\% in 2010 and 93.7\% in 2011), highest ear length (18.4 cm in 2010 and 18.5 cm in 2011), highest ear diameter (45.2 mm in 2010 and 46.5 mm in 2011), highest ear weight (229.1 g in 2010 and 227.1 g in 2011), highest number of kernels per ear (562.1 grains in 2010 and 552.3 grains in 2011), highest fresh ear yield (14,952.6 kg ha-1 in 2010 and 14,805.2 kg ha-1 in 2011), and highest fresh ear numbers (65,781.8 cobs ha-1 in 2010 and 65,789.6 cobs ha-1 in 2011) were determined from the plastic mulch practices on 1 May, the latest sowing date.

Smectite, vermiculite, kaolinite, halloysite, gibbsite, and calcite were quantified from thermal data, hydroxyinterlayered vermiculite and quartz from XRD, using indigenous kaolinite determined by thermal methods as an internal standard, and free iron oxides and mica from XRES analysis. The mean total recovery on 79 samples was 99.9 ± 0.6\%. Very good agreement and small average deviations were obtained between mineral quantities determined by these procedures and values reported by other laboratories for several of the same samples. Because the accuracy of the data exceeded most quantitative mineralogical interpretative needs, these methods can be used for routine quantitative mineralogical characterization of most southern soils.},

Plastic debris is a prolific, long-lived pollutant that is highly resistant to environmental degradation, readily adheres hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants and is linked to morbidity and mortality in numerous aquatic organisms. The prevalence of MPs within the natural environment is a symptom of continuous and rapid growth in synthetic plastic production and mismanagement of plastic waste. Many terrestrial and marine-based processes, including domestic and industrial drainage, maritime activities agricultural runoff and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent, contribute to MP pollution in aquatic environments. MPs have been identified in food consumed by human and in air samples, and exposure to MPs via ingestion or inhalation could lead to adverse human health effects. Regulations in many countries have already been established or will soon be implemented to reduce MPs in aquatic environments. This review focuses on the occurrence, sources, and transport of MPs in terrestrial and aquatic environments to highlight potential human health effects, and applicable regulations to mitigate impacts of MPs. This study also highlights the importance of personality traits and cognitive ability in reducing the entry of MPs into the environment.},

  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, Soil quality assessment may be one of the most contentious topics ever debated by the soil science community. Our objective is to examine the history, present status, and potential for using soil quality assessment as a tool to monitor soil physical, chemical, and biological effects of management decisions that may affect soil and water resources. Differences between inherent and dynamic soil quality and various approaches for assessment are identified and discussed. Four assessment indices, the Agroecosystem Performance Assessment Tool (AEPAT), Soil Conditioning Index (SCI), Cornell Soil Health Test, and Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) are examined. The SCI predicts changes in soil organic matter (SOM) and is a good first step toward more comprehensive assessment, but it focuses only on a single indicator. The AEPAT, Cornell Soil Health Assessment, and SMAF offer a more comprehensive soil quality assessment by including biological, chemical, and physical indicators. One SMAF study showed that including at least three years of forage resulted in higher index values than growing continuous corn (Zea mays L.) because the latter had lower soil pH, decreased macro-aggregate stability, and lower microbial biomass carbon. Another study within the Iowa River South Fork watershed showed that overall, soils were functioning at 87\% of their full potential. The lowest indicator score was associated with SOM (0.60) because the average value was only 28.4 g kg-1. A third study showed that the SMAF could separate cropping groups not recognized by the SCI. Opportunities for collaboration to further improve the SMAF are discussed with the long-term goal being to provide tools to help guide soil management and use decisions and thus ensure longterm sustainability of our soil, air and water resources.},

Field analysis revealed that 8 of 9 tested invertebrate species from the North Sea and 68\% of analyzed individuals of brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the Swedish West Coast had microplastics in them.

Starch has been considered as an excellent candidate to partially substitute synthetic polymer in packaging, agricultural mulch and other low-cost applications. Recently, the starch granules were plasticized using different plasticizers under heating and shearing, giving rise to a continues phase in the form of a viscous melt which can be processed using traditional plastic processing techniques, such as injection molding and extrusion. This kind of starch composites is called thermoplastic starch. Unfortunately, thermoplastic starch presents some drawbacks, such as low degradation temperatures, which make it difficult to process, poor mechanical properties and high water susceptibility. Much work has been carried out to overcome these drawbacks, including the combination of thermoplastic starch with other polymers, aiming at lowering the cost and enhancing the biodegradability of the final product.},

  abstract = {The use of plastic mulch in agriculture has increased dramatically in the last 10 years throughout the world. This increase is due to benefits such as increase in soil temperature, reduced weed pressure, moisture conservation, reduction of certain insect pests, higher crop yields, and more efficient use of soil nutrients. However, disposing of used plastic films, which cause pollution, has led to development of photodegradable and biodegradable mulches. Here we review the use of plastic mulches in agriculture, with special reference to biodegradable mulches. Major topics discussed are (1) history of plastic mulch and impact on crop yield and pest management, (2) limitations of polyethylene mulches and potential alternatives, (3) biodegradable and photodegradable plastic mulches, (4) field performance of biodegradable mulches, and (5) use of biodegradable plastic mulches in organic production. We found that (1) despite multiple benefits, removal and disposal of conventional polyethylene mulches remains a major agronomic, economic, and environmental constraint; (2) early use of photodegradable plastic mulch during the 1970s and 1980s, wrongly named biodegradable mulch films, discouraged adoption of new biodegradable mulch films because they were too expensive and their breakdown was unpredictable; (3) biodegradable plastic films are converted through microbial activity in the soil to carbon dioxide, water, and natural substances; (4) polymers such as poly(lactic acid), poly(butylene adipate-coterephthalate), poly(ε-caprolactone), and starch-based polymer blends or copolymers can degrade when exposed to bioactive environments such as soil and compost; (5) with truly biodegradable materials obtained from petroleum and natural resources, opportunity for using biodegradable polymers as agricultural mulch films has become more viable; and (6) the source of polymer and additives may limit use of some biodegradable mulches in organic production. More knowledge is needed on the effect of biodegradable mulches on crop growth, microclimate modifications, soil biota, soil fertility, and yields.},

In the pyrograms of PBT and PET thermally treated at 270°C for 1h, which were prepared as model polymers containing cross-linking structures, an additional peak was commonly observed as well as the main reactive pyrolysis products for the original polyesters such as dimethyl terephthalate. Based on the observed spectra obtained by Py-GC/mass spectrometry and Py-GC/Fourier transform infrared spectrometry measurements, this peak was assigned to the product reflecting a biphenyl-type cross-linking structure. Furthermore, in the pyrograms of kneaded PBT and PET samples also at 270°C for a total of 1h, which were prepared to simulate material recycling, the same peak for the cross-linking structure was also observed, although its intensity was slightly lower than that in the samples thermally treated in air. This fact verified that the biphenyl-type cross-linking structure would be considerably formed during the recycling of PBT and PET, which might in turn contribute to the deteriorated properties of the recycled materials from waste polyesters. Moreover, difference in the formation of the cross-linking between PBT and PET is discussed on the basis of the observed results.},

  abstract = {Plastic has been identified as an emerging contaminant in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Uncertainties remain concerning the amounts present in the environment and the main responsible sources. In this study, the emissions of macro- and microplastics have been mapped for seven polymers in Switzerland. The modeling is based on a complete analysis of the flows from production and use to end-of-life using probabilistic material flow analysis. We estimate that 94 ± 34 g/capita/year of low-density polyethylene, 98 ± 50 g/cap/a of high-density polyethylene, 126 ± 43 g/cap/a of polypropylene, 24 ± 13 g/cap/a of polystyrene, 16 ± 12 g/cap/a of expanded polystyrene, 65 ± 36 g/cap/a of polyvinyl chloride, and 200 ± 120 g/cap/a of polyethylene terephthalate enter the Swiss environment. All polymers combined, 540 ± 140 and 73 ± 14 g/cap/a are emitted into soil as macroplastics and microplastics, respectively, and 13.3 ± 4.9 and 1.8 ± 1.1 g/cap/a are emitted into freshwater as macroplastics and microplastics, respectively. The leading emission pathway is littering for both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Construction, agriculture, and pre- and postconsumer processes cause important emissions of microplastics into soils, and postconsumer processes, textiles, and personal care products release most of the microplastics into waters. Because mass flows into soils are predicted to be 40 times larger than those into waters, more attention should be placed on this compartment. Our work also highlights the importance of referring to specific polymers instead of just “plastics”.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}People often grumble that plastics are too durable. Water bottles, shopping bags, and other trash litter the planet, from Mount Everest to the Mariana Trench, because plastics are ubiquitous and don9t break down easily. But some plastic materials can change over time. They crack and frizzle. They "weep" out additives. They melt into sludge. All of which creates huge headaches for institutions, such as museums, trying to preserve culturally important objects. The variety of plastic objects at risk is dizzying: early radios, avant-garde sculptures, celluloid animation stills from Disney films, David Bowie costumes, the first artificial heart. Museums are doing everything they can to save culturally important items from similar fates. Over the past decade, conservators have developed better tools to identify vulnerable objects. Some conservators have also started to run experiments to shore up preservation practices and arrest decay.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The recovery of dense microplastics requires the use of NaI solutions, a costly process. The aim of this study is to decrease this cost by recycling the NaI solutions and to determine the impact of NaI storage. For studying the NaI recyclability, the solution density and the salt mass have been monitored during ten life cycles. Density, pH and salt mass have been measured for 40days to assess the storage effect. The results show that NaI solutions are recyclable without any density alterations with a total loss of 35.9\% after the 10cycles of use. During storage, chemical reactions may appear but are reversible. Consequently, the use of recycling methods allows for a significant cost reduction. How far the plastic extraction by dense solutions is representative is discussed.},

The reuse of sludge as fertilizer in agricultural practices can lead to accumulation of plastic in the soil. In this study, nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers were synthesized with a passive inorganic tracer to aid in faster and more quantitative analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Using the anaerobic digestate of a pilot wastewater treatment plant spiked with metal-doped plastic, the excess sludge was dewatered, ensuring realistic associations between sludge and plastic. The resulting sludge cake was affixed atop an unsaturated porous-medium column of glass beads to assess: (i) the release of particulate plastic from the sludge, and (ii) the accumulation and mobility of plastic and organic matter through the column (analogous to a soil). A total of three particulate plastic treatments were assessed, in triplicate, where the plastic and mobile organic fractions were monitored for 14 pore water volumes. Due to size-limited transport, low deattachment from the sludge and reduced mobility through the column were found for microplastic fibers ({$>$}95\% retention). However, cotransport between the mobile organic fraction and nanoplastic particles was observed, with 50\% of both retained in the column. These results contribute to the understanding of the fate of particulate plastics and to assessing the associated environmental risks of particle mobility and percolation, particularly for nanoplastics.},

The MP-associated communities were distinct from fungal communities in the surrounding water and on the natural substrate wood. They also differed significantly among sampling locations, pointing towards a substrate and location specific fungal colonization. Members of Chytridiomycota, Cryptomycota and Ascomycota dominated the fungal assemblages, suggesting that both parasitic and saprophytic fungi thrive in MP biofilms. Thus, considering the worldwide increasing accumulation of plastic particles as well as the substantial vector potential of MP, especially these fungal taxa might benefit from MP pollution in the aquatic environment with yet unknown impacts on their worldwide distribution, as well as biodiversity and food web dynamics at large.},

Upon entering a new epoch, the Anthropocene defined by human-driven influences on earth systems, and with the recognition that plastic pollution is one of the hallmarks of this new age, remarkably little is known about the presence, sources, and fate of plastics (and microplastics (MPs)) within African waters. Research in marine regions, most notably around the coast of South Africa, describes the occurrence of MPs in seabirds and fish species. More recently environmental sampling studies in the same area have quantified plastics in both the water column and sediments. However, despite Africa containing some of the largest and deepest of the world’s freshwater lakes, including Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika as part of the African Great Lakes system, and notable freshwater rivers, such as the River Congo and the Nile, the extent of MPs within the inland waters remains largely unreported. In the only study to date to describe MP pollution in the African Great Lakes, a variety of polymers, including polyethylene, polypropylene, and silicone rubber, were recovered from the gastrointestinal tracts of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fished from Lake Victoria. The likely sources of these plastics were considered to be human activities linked to fishing and tourism, and urban waste. In this chapter we discuss the need for research focus on MPs in Africa and how what has been described in the coastal regions and other freshwater environments can be applied to inland African waters. The aforementioned study in Lake Victoria is used to exemplify how small-scale investigations can provide early indications of MP pollution. Lastly we discuss the current challenges and future needs of MP research in African freshwaters.},

The root environment as a solid-liquid matrix depends upon soil structure and moisture condition. A limited oxygen supply restricts the root development and also reduces the nitrogen fixation in peanuts. Soil surface conditions can be altered by mulching and plays a significant role in protecting the plants against deficient aeration during critical periods of growth phases. The effects of eight mulching treatments (rice husk, rice husk-incorporated, paddy straw, sawdust, water mulch, clear polyethylene, black polyethylene and control) on the soil oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) during the various growth phases of peanut crop (Arachis hypogaea L.) were investigated on a lateritic sandy loam soil (ultisols). These experiments were conducted for two consecutive seasons. ODR values were higher in mulched plots. With the progress of growth stages and also in deeper soil depths, the differences between the values of ODR among treatments narrowed down. The influence of mulches on other physical edaphic properties like bulk density, aeration (noncapillary) porosity and soil temperature were also studied. Mulches reduced the surface crusting and thereby soil bulk density; and increased the aeration porosity and ODR. Soil temperature was higher under plastic mulches whereas vegetative mulches suppressed it.},

MP abundance was 10–7630 items~kg−1, with the order of GS-in, GS-out, RS, and MS. Besides the highest MP abundance, rare PE-sheet (4\% of MPs) and increased MP abundance with sizes decreasing were unique for GS-in, implying the presence of internal sources other than PE-film and continued MP accumulation. Contrarily, in other outside soils high PE-sheet appearance (10–31\%) indicated substantial input via fragmentation of applied PE-film (for GS-out and MS) or via surface-runoff (for RS) while drastic decline of small-sized MPs in order of MS {$>$} RS {$>$} GS-out than expected from steady-state fragmentation implied significant removal of MPs by surface runoff and/or infiltration.

Certain commonly used phthalate plasticisers, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, have been implicated in this regard. The evidence for the ability of phthalates to impact on immune and allergic responses has been examined, encompassing epidemiological investigations and results deriving from studies using experimental animals and from analyses in vitro. The epidemiological data provide some evidence that exposure to phthalates may be associated with increased risk of development of allergies and asthma, however, the lack of objective exposure information limits the interpretation. A variety of studies have been performed in mice to examine the influence of phthalate (delivered via various routes of exposure) to impact on immune responses. Measurement of antibody responses is the commonest read out, although other parameters of inflammation such as eosinophil infiltration and cytokine production have been used also. Although certain phthalates, when delivered at appropriate doses, and via an appropriate route, have been reported to impact on immune and inflammatory function in rodents, as yet no consistent pattern has emerged. Results ranged from potentiation of immune or inflammatory responses, to the absence of any effect, to inhibitory or immunosuppressive activity. In addition, comparatively low doses of phthalates have been associated with immune effects only when routes of administration (subcutaneous or intraperitoneal) are used that do not reflect, and are much less relevant for, opportunities for human contact with phthalates. There is clearly a case to be made for the design of more definitive animal studies that will allow development of a more detailed understanding of whether and to what extent, and under what conditions, phthalates are able to effect meaningful changes in immune function that may in turn impact on human health.},

In addition, extractable chemical additives from microplastics have been identified as an important toxicity pathway in the aquatic environment. However, currently, little is known about the effects of such additives on the soil environment. In this study on nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), we adopted an ecotoxicological approach to assess the potential effects of 13 different microplastics (0.001–1\% of soil dry weight) with different characteristics and extractable additives. We found that poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fragments and polyacrylicnitrile (PAN) fibers show the highest toxicity, while high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) fragments induced relatively less adverse effects on nematodes. In addition, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) induced no toxicity within our test concentration range for the acute period. Acute toxicity was mainly attributed to the extractable additives: when the additives were extracted, the toxic effects of each microplastic disappeared in the acute soil toxicity test. The harmful effects of the LDPE films and PAN fibers increased when the microplastics were maintained in the soil for a long-term period with frequent wet–dry cycles. We here provide clear evidence that microplastic toxicity in the soil is highly related to extractable additives. Our results suggest that future experiments consider extractable additives as key explanatory variables.},

Despite the widespread use of plastic mulch, biogeochemical models so far do not yet consider impacts of mulch on soil environmental conditions and biogeochemistry. In this study, we adapted and successfully tested the LandscapeDNDC model against field data by simulating crop growth, C and N turnover and associated N2O emissions as well as nitrate leaching for radish cultivation with plastic mulch and in conjunction with different rates of N fertilization (465–765 kg N ha−1 year−1). Due to the sandy soil texture and monsoon climate, nitrate leaching with rates up to 350 kg N ha−1 year−1 was the dominant reason for overall low nitrogen use efficiency (32–43 \%). Direct or indirect N2O emissions (calculated from simulated nitrate leaching rates and IPCC EFind = 0.0075) ranged between 2 and 3 kg N ha−1 year−1, thus contributing an equal amount to total field emissions of about 5 kg N ha−1 year−1. Based on our results, emission factors for direct N2O emissions ranged between 0.004 and 0.005. These values are only half of the IPCC default value (0.01), demonstrating the need of biogeochemical models for developing site and/or region specific EFs. Simulation results also revealed that changes in agricultural management by applying the fertilizer only to the rows would be an efficient mitigation strategy, effectively decreasing field nitrate leaching and N2O emissions by 50–60 \%.},

  abstract = {The world's soils contain about 1500 Gt of organic carbon to a depth of 1m and a further 900 Gt from 1--2m. A change of total soil organic carbon by just 10\% would thus be equivalent to all the anthropogenic CO2 emitted over 30 years. Warming is likely to increase both the rate of decomposition and net primary production (NPP), with a fraction of NPP forming new organic carbon. Evidence from various sources can be used to assess whether NPP or the rate of decomposition has the greater temperature sensitivity, and, hence, whether warming is likely to lead to an increase or decrease in soil organic carbon. Evidence is reviewed from laboratory-based incubations, field measurements of organic carbon storage, carbon isotope ratios and soil respiration with either naturally varying temperatures or after experimentally increasing soil temperatures. Estimates of terrestrial carbon stored at the Last Glacial Maximum are also reviewed. The review concludes that the temperature dependence of organic matter decomposition can be best described as: d(T) = exp[3.36 (T − 40)/(T + 31.79)] where d(T) is the normalised decomposition rate at temperature T (in °C). In this equation, decomposition rate is normalised to ‘1’ at 40 °C. The review concludes by simulating the likely changes in soil organic carbon with warming. In summary, it appears likely that warming will have the effect of reducing soil organic carbon by stimulating decomposition rates more than NPP. However, increasing CO2 is likely to simultaneously have the effect of increasing soil organic carbon through increases in NPP. Any changes are also likely to be very slow. The net effect of changes in soil organic carbon on atmospheric CO2 loading over the next decades to centuries is, therefore, likely to be small.},

Recent sequencing results indicate that potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. might be present on floating microplastics. Hence, these particles might function as vectors for the dispersal of pathogens. Microplastics and water samples collected in the North and Baltic Sea were subjected to selective enrichment for pathogenic Vibrio species. Bacterial colonies were isolated from CHROMagar™Vibrio and assigned to Vibrio spp. on the species level by MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation – Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry). Respective polymers were identified by ATR FT-IR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform – Infrared Spectroscopy). We discovered potentially pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus on a number of microplastic particles, e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene from North/Baltic Sea. This study confirms the indicated occurrence of potentially pathogenic bacteria on marine microplastics and highlights the urgent need for detailed biogeographical analyses of marine microplastics.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular structure of soil organic matter (SOM), and on extensive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solution. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere complexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to mineral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moieties of other amphiphilic molecules. This process can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose components may exchange more easily with the surrounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with considerable force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interactions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the surrounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here offers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments.},

  abstract = {Synthetic polymers are one of the most significant pollutants in the aquatic environment. Most research focused on small plastic particles, so-called microplastics (particle size, 1–5,000 μm). Compared to macroplastics, the small size complicates their determination in environmental samples and demands for more sophisticated analytical approaches. The detection methods of microplastics reported in the past are highly diverse. This chapter summarizes different strategies for the sampling of water and sediment and sample treatments, including the separation of plastic particles and removal of natural debris that are necessary prior the identification of microplastics. Moreover, the techniques used for the identification of plastics particles are presented in this chapter.With the application of the method described in this chapter, microplastics were detected in freshwater systems, such as rivers and lakes worldwide. The abundance of microplastics reported in the studies varied in more than three orders of magnitude.Furthermore, microplastics are not uniform, as there are many different types of synthetic polymers commercially available. Consequently, a variety of different polymer types is present in the aquatic environment. The knowledge on the type of polymer provides additional information for scientists: the type of polymer dictates its physicochemical properties and the degradation. The environmental degradation of plastics is an important factor for the formation, distribution, and accumulation of microplastics in the aquatic system. Thus, this chapter also summarizes the degradation pathways for synthetic polymers in the environment.},

  abstract = {Only few studies investigated the input of microplastic particles via the atmosphere, so far. Here, we present results on microplastic concentrations in the atmospheric deposition in the metropolitan region of Hamburg. In total, six investigation sites were equipped with three bulk precipitation samplers each and sampled biweekly over 12 weeks (12/17–03/18). Three sites were located in a rural area south of Hamburg comprising one open field site and two throughfall sites under beech/oak and Douglas fir forest canopy, respectively. Three further sites were selected within the city following a transect from north to south representing urban sites of varying degrees concerning population, traffic and industrial pressures. Particles and fibers were counted under UV light within a photo box and under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Lab A.1, Zeiss). Results show that microplastic particles are ubiquitous at all sites. A median abundance between 136.5 and 512.0 microplastic particles per m2/day has been found over the sampling period. This equals a mean microplastic abundance of 275 particles/m2/day μRaman spectroscopy showed that polyethylenes/ethylvinyl acetate copolymers are dominating significantly (48.8 and 22.0\%, respectively), 16 particles analyzed (14.6\%) were identified as contamination from PE (polyethylene) samplers. In contrast to other studies, fragments were significantly dominating compared to fibers. The spatial distribution comparing the urban sites concentrations followed in the order from high to low: “north” (Henstedt-Ulzburg, low population density, suburb) – “center” (University; large population density) – “south” (Wilhelmsburg, middle population density, port and industrial facilities) with highly varying concentrations within the time series. Surprisingly, the rural sites in the southern part of Hamburg showed highest concentrations (Douglas fir {$>$} open field {$>$} beech/oak). This finding is most likely a result of factors such as the comb out capacity of the different forest types and/or direct input pathways from the agricultural areas and the nearby highway.},

Because of properties such as buoyancy and extreme durability, synthetic polymers are present in rivers, lakes, and oceans and accumulate in sediments all over the world. However, freshwater sediments have attracted less attention than the investigation of sediments in marine ecosystems. For this reason, river shore sediments of the rivers Rhine and Main in the Rhine-Main area in Germany were analyzed. The sample locations comprised shore sediment of a large European river (Rhine) and a river characterized by industrial influence (Main) in areas with varying population sizes as well as sites in proximity to nature reserves. All sediments analyzed contained microplastic particles ({$<$}5 mm) with mass fractions of up to 1 g kg(-1) or 4000 particles kg(-1). Analysis of the plastics by infrared spectroscopy showed a large abundance of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, which covered more than 75\% of all polymer types identified in the sediment. Short distance transport of plastic particles from the tributary to the main stream could be confirmed by the identification of pellets, which were separated from shore sediment samples of both rivers. This systematic study shows the emerging pollution of inland river sediments with microplastics and, as a consequence thereof, underlines the importance of rivers as vectors of transport of microplastics into the ocean.},

In this study, we tested the sensitivity of natural freshwater sediment bacterial communities (by genetic fingerprint) to exposure to microplastics (polyethylene, 2 and 20 mg/g sediment) and microplastics loaded with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, phenanthrene and anthracene), using a laboratory-based approach. After two weeks of incubation, the bacterial community composition from an unpolluted river section was altered by high concentrations of microplastics, whereas the community downstream of a wastewater treatment plant remained unchanged. Low microplastic concentrations loaded with phenanthrene or anthracene induced a less pronounced response in the sediment communities compared to the same total amount of phenanthrene or anthracene alone. In addition, biodegradation of the PAHs was reduced. This study shows, that microplastic can affect bacterial community composition in unpolluted freshwater sediments. Moreover, the results indicate that microplastics can serve as a vehicle for hydrophobic pollutants but bioavailability of the latter is reduced by the sorption to microplastics.},

In this study, samples from road environments were analyzed for their TRWP contents and concentrations of eight organic tire constituents. TRWP concentrations were determined by quantifying Zn in the density fraction {$<$}1.9~g/cm³ and by thermal extraction desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TED-GC/MS) and the concentrations ranged from 3.7 to 480~mg TRWP/g. Strong and statistically significant correlations with TRWPs were found for 2-hydroxybenzothiazole and 2-aminobenzothiazole, indicating that these substances may be suitable markers of TRWPs. The mass distribution of TRWPs in road dust suggests that the main mass fraction formed on roads consists of coarse particles ({$>$}100~µm). Data for a sedimentation basin indicate that the fine fraction ({$<$}50~µm) is preferentially transported by road runoff into receiving waters. The size distribution and density data of TRWP gathered by three different quantitation approaches also suggest that aging of TRWPs leads to changes in their particle density. An improved understanding of the dynamics of TRWP properties is essential to assess the distribution and dissipation of this contaminant of emerging concern in the environment.},

The hypothesis is often cited and has gained momentum, turning it into paradigm status. We provide a critical evaluation of the scientific literature regarding this hypothesis. Using new calculations based on published studies, we explain the sometimes contrasting views and unify them in one interpretive framework. One explanation for the contrasting views among studies is that they test different hypotheses. When reframed in the context of the above hypothesis, the available data become consistent. We show that HOC microplastic-water partitioning can be assumed to be at equilibrium for most microplastic residing in the oceans. We calculate the fraction of total HOC sorbed by plastics to be small compared to that sorbed by other media in the ocean. We further demonstrate consistency among (a) measured HOC transfer from microplastic to organisms in the laboratory, (b) measured HOC desorption rates for polymers in artificial gut fluids (c) simulations by plastic-inclusive bioaccumulation models and (d) HOC desorption rates for polymers inferred from first principles. We conclude that overall the flux of HOCs bioaccumulated from natural prey overwhelms the flux from ingested microplastic for most habitats, which implies that microplastic ingestion is not likely to increase the exposure to and thus risks of HOCs in the marine environment.},

However, there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling, extraction and identification methods for microplastics. Accordingly, we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources. This includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water, groundwater, tap water and bottled drinking water. Studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed. We review and propose best practices to sample, extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations. Further, we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. Microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water, and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude (1 × 10−2 to 108 \#/m3) across individual samples and water types. However, only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria, implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The order in globally detected polymers in these studies is PE ≈ PP {$>$} PS {$>$} PVC {$>$} PET, which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for PVC and PET to settle as a result of their higher densities. Fragments, fibres, film, foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes. We conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water, to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in microplastic may pose a risk to aquatic organisms. Here we develop and analyze a conceptual model that simulates the effects of plastic on bioaccumulation of POPs. The model accounts for dilution of exposure concentration by sorption of POPs to plastic (POP “dilution”), increased bioaccumulation by ingestion of plastic-containing POPs (“carrier”), and decreased bioaccumulation by ingestion of clean plastic (“cleaning”). The model is parametrized for the lugworm Arenicola marina and evaluated against recently published bioaccumulation data for this species from laboratory bioassays with polystyrene microplastic. Further scenarios include polyethylene microplastic, nanosized plastic, and open marine systems. Model analysis shows that plastic with low affinity for POPs such as polystyrene will have a marginal decreasing effect on bioaccumulation, governed by dilution. For stronger sorbents such as polyethylene, the dilution, carrier, and cleaning mechanism are more substantial. In closed laboratory bioassay systems, dilution and cleaning dominate, leading to decreased bioaccumulation. Also in open marine systems a decrease is predicted due to a cleaning mechanism that counteracts biomagnification. However, the differences are considered too small to be relevant from a risk assessment perspective.},

Their characterization is essential, because knowledge of the molecular structures constituting SOM allows for the detailed understanding of its origin and the processes implicated in soil C sequestration. This provides the basis for target-oriented development of management practices to optimize ecosystem services provided by soil. The aim of this review is to give an overview about the major analytical developments and the information gain that could be achieved by application of molecular methods in SOM research. Up to the 1980s, studies concentrated on the characterization of the chemical nature of SOM. Analyses were mainly based on soluble OM compounds, which were fractionated chemically into humic and fulvic acids. During the 1990s, the focus changed and scientists were more interested in biological processes controlling SOM formation and its dynamics. Introduction of physical fractionation and combination of molecular and isotopic techniques allowed assessment of composition, origin, and turnover of SOM within specific localizations in the mineral soil matrix. Analyses of the dynamics of single molecules led to a massive change of paradigms. Long residence times of SOM are no longer explained by chemical recalcitrance but by microbial products being stabilized by the interaction with soil minerals and microbial inaccessibility. In recent years, techniques yielding results with high molecular and spatial resolution were introduced, which will allow the acquisition of much more detailed information, moving a step further toward elucidating the nature and properties of SOM.},

  abstract = {Wear and tear from tyres significantly contributes to the flow of (micro-)plastics into the environment. This paper compiles the fragmented knowledge on tyre wear and tear characteristics, amounts of particles emitted, pathways in the environment, and the possible effects on humans. The estimated per capita emission ranges from 0.23 to 4.7 kg/year, with a global average of 0.81 kg/year. The emissions from car tyres (100\%) are substantially higher than those of other sources of microplastics, e.g., airplane tyres (2\%), artificial turf (12–50\%), brake wear (8\%) and road markings (5\%). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tyre wear and tear to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5–10\%. In air, 3–7\% of the particulate matter (PM2.5) is estimated to consist of tyre wear and tear, indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The wear and tear also enters our food chain, but further research is needed to assess human health risks. It is concluded here that tyre wear and tear is a stealthy source of microplastics in our environment, which can only be addressed effectively if awareness increases, knowledge gaps on quantities and effects are being closed, and creative technical solutions are being sought. This requires a global effort from all stakeholders; consumers, regulators, industry and researchers alike.},

Because most of the sources are land based, concerns are increasingly focused on the freshwater and terrestrial environment. Fate and transport models for plastic debris can complement information from measurements and will play an important role in the prospective risk assessment of plastic debris. We review the present knowledge with respect to fate and transport modeling of plastic debris in freshwater catchment areas, focusing especially on nano- and microplastics. Starting with a brief overview of theory and models for nonplastic particles, we discuss plastic-specific properties, processes, and existing mass-balance-, multimedia-, and spatiotemporally explicit fate models. We find that generally many theoretical and conceptual approaches from models developed earlier for other types of (low density) particles apply also to plastic debris. A unique feature of plastic debris, however, is its combination of high persistence, low density, and extremely wide size distribution, ranging from the nanometer to the {$>$}cm scale. This causes the system behavior of plastic debris to show a far wider variety than most other materials or chemicals. We provide recommendations for further development of these models and implications and guidance for how fate and transport models can be used in a framework for the tiered risk assessment of plastic debris.},

Many studies struggle with this complexity and either address only a part of this diversity or present data using discrete classifications for sizes, shapes, and densities. We argue that such classifications will never be fully satisfactory, as any definition using classes does not capture the essentially continuous nature of environmental microplastic. Therefore, we propose to simplify microplastics by fully defining them through a three-dimensional (3D) probability distribution, with size, shape, and density as dimensions. In addition to introducing the concept, we parametrize these probability distributions, using empirical data. This parametrization results in an approximate yet realistic representation of “true” environmental microplastic. This approach to simplifying microplastic could be applicable to exposure measurements, effect studies, and fate modeling. Furthermore, it allows for easy comparison between studies, irrespective of sampling or laboratory setup. We demonstrate how the 3D probability distribution of environmental versus ingested microplastic can be helpful in understanding the bioavailability of and exposure to microplastic. We argue that the concept of simplified microplastic will also be helpful in probabilistic risk modeling, which would greatly enhance our understanding of the risk that microplastics pose to the environment.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest size-selective removal of small plastic particles from the ocean surface, an observation that remains unexplained. We studied one of the hypotheses regarding this size-selective removal: the formation of a biofilm on the microplastics (biofouling). We developed the first theoretical model that is capable of simulating the effect of biofouling on the fate of microplastic. The model is based on settling, biofilm growth, and ocean depth profiles for light, water density, temperature, salinity, and viscosity. Using realistic parameters, the model simulates the vertical transport of small microplastic particles over time, and predicts that the particles either float, sink to the ocean floor, or oscillate vertically, depending on the size and density of the particle. The predicted size-dependent vertical movement of microplastic particles results in a maximum concentration at intermediate depths. Consequently, relatively low abundances of small particles are predicted at the ocean surface, while at the same time these small particles may never reach the ocean floor. Our results hint at the fate of “lost” plastic in the ocean, and provide a start for predicting risks of exposure to microplastics for potentially vulnerable species living at these depths.},

N2O can be produced by nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and by nitrifiers paradoxically denitrifying. The latter pathway, though well-known in pure culture, has only recently been demonstrated in soils. Moreover, nitrifier denitrification appeared to be much less important than classical nitrate-driven denitrification. Here we studied a poor sandy soil, and show that when moisture conditions are sub-optimal for denitrification, nitrifier denitrification can be a major contributor to N2O emission from this soil. We conclude that the relative importance of classical and nitrifier denitrification in N2O emitted from soil is a function of the soil moisture content, and likely of other environmental conditions as well. Accordingly, we suggest that nitrifier denitrification should be routinely considered as a major source of N2O from soil.},

New approaches are vital to address challenges related to plastics waste heterogeneity, along with the property reductions induced by mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling and upcycling of polymers may enable circularity through separation strategies, chemistries that promote closed-loop recycling inherent to macromolecular design, and transformative processes that shift the life-cycle landscape. Polymer upcycling schemes may enable lower-energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional mechanical and chemical recycling.

These microplastics accumulate in soils, sediments, and freshwater bodies, and some are conveyed via wind and water to the oceans. The concentration gradient between terrestrial inland and coastal regions, the factors that influence the concentration, and the fundamental transport processes that could dynamically affect the distribution of microplastics are unclear. We analyzed microplastic concentration reported in 196 studies from 49 countries or territories from all continents and found that microplastic concentrations in soils or sediments and surface water could vary by up to eight orders of magnitude. Mean microplastic concentrations in inland locations such as glacier (191 n L−1) and urban stormwater (55 n L−1) were up to two orders of magnitude greater than the concentrations in rivers (0.63 n L−1) that convey microplastics from inland locations to water bodies in terrestrial boundary such as estuaries (0.15 n L−1). However, only 20\% of studies reported microplastics below 20~μm, indicating the concentration in these systems can change with the improvement of microplastic detection technology. Analysis of data from laboratory studies reveals that biodegradation can also reduce the concentration and size of deposited microplastics in the terrestrial environment. Fiber percentage was higher in the sediments in the coastal areas than the sediments in inland water bodies, indicating fibers are preferentially transported to the terrestrial boundary. Finally, we provide theoretical frameworks to predict microplastics transport and identify potential hotspots where microplastics may accumulate.},

The sinking velocity was not solely related to particle density, size and fluid density but also to the particles shape leading to considerable deviation from calculated theoretical values. Thus, experimental studies are indispensable to get basic knowledge about the sinking behaviour and to gain representative datasets for model approaches estimating the distribution of microplastics in aquatic systems. The sinking behaviour may be altered considerably by weathering and biofouling demanding further studies with aged and fouled plastic particles. Furthermore, assumptions are made about the influence of sinking fouled microplastics on the marine carbon pump by transferring organic carbon to deeper water depths.},

Microplastics are a by-product of exactly these modernization processes, being distributed globally by physical processes like ocean currents, and causing effects far from their place of origin. In recent years, the topic has gained great prominence, as microplastics have been discovered nearly everywhere in the environment, raising questions about the impacts on food for human consumption. But are microplastics really a new phenomenon or rather a symptom of an old problem? And exactly what risks are involved? It seems that the phenomenon has accelerated political action—the USA has passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015—and industries have pledged to fade out the use of microbeads in their cosmetic products. At first sight, is it a success for environmentalists and the protection of our planet?This chapter deals with these questions by adopting a social-ecological perspective, discussing microplastics as a global risk. Taking four main characteristics of global risks, we develop four arguments to discuss (a) the everyday production of risk by societies, (b) scientific risk evaluation of microplastics, (c) social responses, and (d) problems of risk management. To illustrate these four issues, we draw on different aspects of the current scientific and public debate. In doing so, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the social-ecological implications of microplastics.},

Water-saving rice production techniques are therefore increasingly searched for. Here we present the first study of trace gas emissions from a water-saving rice production system where soils are mulched and are kept close to field capacity in order to compare their contribution to global warming with traditional paddy rice. In a two-year field experiment close to Beijing, CH4 and N2O fluxes were monitored in two forms of the Ground Cover Rice Production System (GCRPS) and in traditional paddy fields using closed chambers. With paddy rice the observed CH4 emissions were very low, about 0.3 g CH4 m−2 a−1 in 2001 and about 1 g CH4 m−2 a−1 in 2002. In GCRPS, the CH4 emissions were negligible. N2O fluxes in GCRPS were similar, 0.5 to 0.6 g N2O m−2 a−1 in 2001 and 2002, and emission peaks mainly followed fertilizer applications. In paddy rice, N2O fluxes were unexpectedly low throughout the year 2001 (0.03 g N2O m−2 a−1), and in 2002 larger emissions occurred during the drainage period. So with 0.4 g N2O m−2 a−1 the cumulative flux was similar to emissions in GCRPS. Total CO2 equivalent fluxes calculated according to IPCC methodology were tenfold higher in GCRPS compared to paddy in 2001. In 2002, fluxes from both systems were similar with 175 and 141 g CO2 equivalents m−2 a−1 from GCRPS and paddy.},

  abstract = {Thermogravimetry is a technique measuring mass change during programmed heating. In soil analysis, it is used for determination of content of volatile fractions, thermally labile and stable fractions of soil organic matter and minerals. One method of data analysis uses the determination of mass losses in 10°C temperature areas. In the past, their mutual correlation revealed several larger temperature areas of mass losses, which appeared to be universal for all types of soils equilibrated at the same relative humidity. However, it is unclear if mass losses in these temperature areas are connected with biogeochemical functions or processes in soil. In this work, using data from {$>$}300 soils of different types, geographical origin, and land uses we demonstrate their linear correlation with content of organic C, total N and clay content and biological activity or their combinations. In particular, the results showed that mass losses between 200 and 300°C, which is related to thermally labile fraction, correlates best with total organic C and less with total organic N. From 300 to 450°C represents a more stabilized soil organic matter pool and can be best described by either by C or N contents. Mass loss 450–550°C correlates strongly with clay content, which suggests a connection to organo-clay complexes. The low temperature interval of 30–200°C, which corresponded to weakly and strongly bound water showed a strong connection with clay content, but a weaker connection to microbial activity. The developed equations were corrected and verified using additional soil sample sets. The correlations along with their universal applicability lead to conclusion about the possible connection of mass losses in these temperature areas to, still unknown, biogeochemical soil functions. The obtained equations may represent a new approach of rapid and universally applicable “mathematical” fractionation requiring only contents of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, clay and water in soil equilibrated at 76\% relative humidity.},

  abstract = {Soil samples collected in South America, North America and West Siberia were measured by thermogravimetry to verify the connection between mass losses and soil respiration represented by the rate and amount of carbon dioxide measured under laboratory conditions. It was demonstrated that linear correlation between those parameters is a common feature for soils originating from different climatic and geographic regions. Significant coefficients of determination were observed in temperature areas corresponding to the moisture evaporation and degradation of soil organic matter (SOM). It was concluded that the correlations are the consequences of soil-forming processes mediated by microorganisms over a long time period. The comparison of experimental data with earlier results showed that disturbance of those processes causes the decrease in observed correlations. The subtraction of thermal mass losses of incubated and non-incubated soils revealed the change in water holding character in all samples, which was ascribed to the transformation of SOM and its water-holding properties during the incubation. In contrast, the changes in thermal mass losses above 200 °C showed that this area reflects the specificity of biological transformation of each soil sample. Further, applied approach and obtained results indicate the necessity of very gentle soil sample preparation and especially gentle air drying to get comparable results about intrinsic soils’ features in different regions.},

  abstract = {Properties and compositions of soils originating from different sources usually vary, depending largely on the conditions of soil forming processes and parent materials. Our previous investigations of soils from contrasting localities showed linear correlations between carbon dioxide produced by soil microorganisms and thermal mass losses of air-dried soils recorded using thermogravimetry. The correlations were observed at temperatures corresponding both to moisture evaporation and thermal degradation of soil organic matter. In this work, those soils were combined into one group and the correlation analysis was repeated using both linear and power functions. Whereas the linear dependency between respiration and water evaporation was confirmed; the connection between respiration and thermal decay of organic matter appeared to follow power function. These findings indicate the existence of fundamental unifying principles in soil forming processes, in terms of water binding and clay-dependent organic carbon sequestration, notwithstanding the fact, that soils develop under contrasting conditions. Additional soils were analyzed in order to test the applicability of obtained models for prediction of soil respiration using thermogravimetry. The results indicate a promising potential of this method mainly for soils originating from areas undisturbed by anthropogenic activity.},

Research on SOM stabilization mechanisms during the last decades opened access to new approaches of SOM assessment. This study tried to empower this trend with a focus on the interrelations between soil components including clay, organic carbon and bound water toward a unifying assessment for practical land use. Soil samples from different regions of the world were collected, air-dried, sieved and equilibrated to 76~\% relative humidity prior to analysis. Thermogravimetry was applied to search for a relationship between thermal mass losses corresponding to soil components and mass losses on ignition (MLI) between 110 and 550~°C. The results refer to a predictability of MLI from thermal mass losses in two 10~°C temperature steps (TML), which are both closely correlated with the content of clay and soil organic carbon (SOC), respectively. We found a relationship MLI~=~10~×~TML130–140~°C~+~25~×~TML320–330~°C~−~2 with R 2~=~0.98, applicable for soils with a wide range of properties. Using previous results, this equation can be rewritten as SOC~=~0.48~×~MLI–0.12~×~clay~+~0.2, which is similar to previously published relationship. The application of equation to plots with varying fertilization in long-term field experiments revealed deviations, which could be explained by different amounts of biologically degradable, non-humified, fresh organic residues or similar organic admixtures. This assumption was tested by application to untouched by human activity soils before and after laboratory incubation. The microbiological decay of SOM in incubated samples led to significantly lower differences of calculated and measured MLI, confirming a decrease in the amount of fresh organic matter. We conclude that thermogravimetry is applicable to study interrelations between soil components and to assess soil organic carbon content and quality.},

In this study 63 synthetic materials and 11 other dietary items and non-plastic marine debris were tested.

In the agricultural soils, major causes of MPs pollution include application of biosolids and compost, wastewater irrigation, mulching film, polymer-based fertilizers and pesticides, and atmospheric deposition. The fate and dispersion of MPs in the soil environment are mainly associated with the soil characteristics, cultivation practices, and diversity of soil biota. Although there is emerging pollution of MPs in the soil environment, no standardized detection and quantification techniques are available. This study comprehensively reviews the sources, fate, and dispersion of MPs in the soil environment, discusses the interactions and effects of MPs on soil biota, and highlights the recent advancements in detection and quantification methods of MPs. The prospects for future research include biomagnification potency, cytotoxic effects on human/animals, nonlinear behavior in the soil environment, standardized analytical methods, best management practices, and global policies in the agricultural industry for the sake of sustainable development.},

This chapter mainly deals with the source and contamination of microplastics in the agricultural soil and groundwater. Moreover, the experimental approach has been adopted to extract and investigate the presence of microplastics in the soil and groundwater and to classify microplastics based on their physical appearances, such as mass, shape, size, color, and chemical properties like diversity of microplastics characterized using Raman spectroscopy as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Sources of microplastics have been reported either in the aquatic environment or in the terrestrial ecosystem, which is widely described and noted down with respective experimental techniques for identification and quantification of microplastics in this chapter. Agricultural soils were stated to be dumping sites for waste collected from households in rural, urban, and industrial areas. Therefore, sewage sludge, industrial effluents, paints, discarded plastics, households materials, and fertilizers are common contributors of microplastics in agricultural soils and groundwater either through biological agents or vertical transport into aquifers. This chapter highlights the source, extraction approach, and quantification techniques for microplastics being applied in numerous research across the globe. The presence of microplastics in soil is affecting soil properties such as water infiltration capacity, bulk density, microbial activity, and soil structure. The chapter analytically argues the recent progress in various extraction, identification, and quantification process aims to identify the pertinent gaps in agricultural soils and groundwater and offers possible solutions by briefing the ongoing investigation to preclude these gaps through applicable scientific interventions.},

However, most of the techniques used by researchers in this area are inadequate to provide evidence of the final stage: assimilation. In this review, we describe the different stages of biodegradation and we state several techniques used by some authors working in this domain. Validate assimilation (including mineralization) is an important aspect to guarantee the real biodegradability of items of consumption (in particular friendly environmental new materials). Since LDPE is considered to be practically inert, efforts were made to isolate unique microorganisms capable of utilizing LDPEs. Recent data showed that biodegradation of LDPE waste with selected microbial strains became a viable solution. Among biological agents, microbial enzymes are one of the most powerful tools for the biodegradation of LDPEs. Activity of biodegradation of most enzymes is higher in fungi than in bacteria. It is important to consider fungal degradation of LDPE in order to understand what is necessary for biodegradation and the mechanisms involved. This requires understanding of the interactions between materials and microorganisms and the biochemical changes involved. Widespread studies on the biodegradation of LDPEs have been carried out in order to overcome the environmental problems associated with LDPE waste. This paper reviews the current research on the biodegradation of LDPEs and also use of various techniques for the analysis of degradation in vitro.},

Although we have an advanced mechanistic understanding of individual degradation processes of soils under agricultural use, general concepts of agropedogenesis are absent. A unifying theory of soil development under agricultural practices, of agropedogenesis, is urgently needed. We introduce a theory of anthropedogenesis – soil development under the main factor “humankind” – the sixth factor of soil formation, and deepen it to encompass agropedogenesis as the most important direction of anthropedogenesis. The developed theory of agropedogenesis consists of (1) broadening the classical concept of {$<$}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mtext{$>$}factors{$<$}/mtext{$><$}mo{$>$}→{$<$}/mo{$><$}mtext{$>$}processes{$<$}/mtext{$><$}mo{$>$}→{$<$}/mo{$><$}mtext{$>$}properties{$<$}/mtext{$><$}mo{$>$}→{$<$}/mo{$><$}mtext{$>$}functions{$<$}/mtext{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}{$<$}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="226pt" height="12pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="b003bd8c22036a899806f3db1ea290fb"{$><$}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bg-16-4783-2019-ie00001.svg" width="226pt" height="12pt" src="bg-16-4783-2019-ie00001.png"/{$><$}/svg:svg{$>$} along with their feedbacks to the processes, (2) a new concept of attractors of soil degradation, (3) selection and analysis of master soil properties, (4) analysis of phase diagrams of master soil properties to identify thresholds and stages of soil degradation, and, finally, (5) a definition of the multidimensional attractor space of agropedogenesis. The main feature of anthropedogenesis is the narrowing of soil development to only one function (e.g. crop production for agropedogenesis), and this function is becoming the main soil-forming factor. The focus on only one function and the disregard of other functions inevitably lead to soil degradation. We show that the factor humankind dominates over the effects of the five natural soil-forming factors and that agropedogenesis is therefore much faster than natural soil formation. The direction of agropedogenesis is largely opposite to that of natural soil development and is thus usually associated with soil degradation. In contrast to natural pedogenesis leading to \emph{divergence} of soil properties, agropedogenesis leads to their \emph{convergence} because of the efforts to optimize conditions for crop production. Agricultural practices lead soil development toward a quasi-steady state with a predefined range of measured properties – attractors (an attractor is a minimal or maximal value of a soil property toward which the property will develop via long-term intensive agricultural use from any natural state). Based on phase diagrams and expert knowledge, we define a set of “master properties” (bulk density and macroaggregates, soil organic matter content, C:N ratio, pH and electrical conductivity – EC, microbial biomass and basal respiration) as well as soil depth (A and B horizons). These master properties are especially sensitive to land use and determine the other properties during agropedogenesis. Phase diagrams of master soil properties help identify thresholds and stages of soil degradation, each of which is characterized by one dominating process. Combining individual attractors in a multidimensional attractor space enables predicting the trajectory and the final state of agrogenic soil development and developing measures to combat soil degradation. In conclusion, the suggested new theory of anthro- and agropedogenesis is a prerequisite for merging various degradation processes into a general view and for understanding the functions of humankind not only as the sixth soil-forming factor but also as an ecosystem engineer optimizing its environment to fulfil a few desired functions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The use of plastic mulch offers an economically profitable approach for producing sweet corn (Zea mays L.) in Newfoundland (Canada) because of its warming effect on the soil and air around emerging plants in late spring. Information on the combined use of plastic mulch and planting dates is needed to develop a base for future research and on-farm maximum economic yield demonstration programs. Studies were conducted from May to mid-October in 2001, 2002, and 2003 to determine the effects of mulching and planting dates on days from planting to maturity (DH), total marketable yield (TMY) and the economic value (gross returns, GR; net returns, NR; and production efficiency, PE–a measure of output/input ratio) of sweet corn. The experiment was structured as a split plot design in a randomized complete block arrangement and three replicates. The main treatment was mulching: plastic mulch (PM) and no mulch (NM), and the subplot treatments were the planting dates: 1, 15 and 29 May, abbreviated PD1, PD2, and PD3, respectively. For each mulch-planting date treatment, matured ears were hand harvested and sold over a 3 wk period. There was no year effect on the measured variables. Planting date had significant effect on DH, TMY and GR. When averaged across planting dates, the PM decreased DH by 10 d. Mulching had significant effect on all variables, except TMY. However, the high premium price obtained from early planting with PM more than offset the extra cost of using plastic mulch. The beneficial effects of PM on GR were consistent across planting dates. With PM, GR had a more favorable response at PD1 than at PD2 or PD3 but with NM, GR was higher at PD2 and similar at PD1 and PD3. The PM increased NR by {$>$} \$3,000.00 (Canadian)-ha− over NM and had a PE of 5.37 compared to 4.94 for NM. The study confirmed the use of plastic mulch as a tool to reduce risk in sweet corn production and with a high potential to increase profitability in Newfoundland.},

  abstract = {The optimum soil temperature required for sweet corn (Zea mays L.) germination is rarely achieved during spring planting in Newfoundland (NL), Canada. Plastic mulches have been used to improve establishment and hasten maturity during the short production season. The effects of cultivar, plastic mulch and planting date on plant growth, yield and quality traits of sweet corn were studied in 2001 and 2002. Two plastic mulch systems: plastic mulch (PM) and no mulch (NM), four sweet corn cultivars: 'Seneca Arrowhead', 'Seneca Daybreak', 'Seneca Horizon', and 'Northern Supersweet', and three planting date treatments (PDTs): 1, 15 and 29 May, were used. The experiment was structured as a split split-plot design in a randomized complete block arrangement and four replicates. Temperature data were taken from air and soil (0.05 m depth) both inside and outside the plastic mulch. Air temperatures from 1 m above soil surface were taken to determine cumulative corn heat units (CHU, base 30/10degreesC). Maximum air and soil temperatures during the first 4 weeks were up to 20degreesC higher under PM than on NM plots. The plots were harvested as corn matured at grain moisture content of between 72 and 78\%. There was no year effect on the variables measured. A plastic x planting date x cultivar interaction observed suggests that some cultivars performed better under plastic depending on the planting date. The influence of plastic cover on plant growth was higher at 1 May and 15 May PDTs than at 29 May PDT. When averaged across planting dates, the PM treatment decreased days from planting to emergence (VE) by 3-5 days and correspondingly decreased silking (R1) by 8-17 days and maturity by 7-13 days. The plastic mulch increased total yield and marketable yield by 8-17 and 3-6\% over no plastic, respectively. The effects of cultivar and PM treatments on marketable yield and the quality-related traits were not consistent across planting dates, although several of the traits had a favorable response to plastic cover, particularly at 1 May and at 15 May PDTs.

  abstract = {Yield of silage corn (Zea mays L.) in Newfoundland (NL), Canada, is limited by low corn heat units (CHU). This is a reflection of generally moderate temperature throughout the growing season in addition to having a late spring and early fall. Clear photo-degradable plastic film, applied to the soil after sowing, may boost soil and air temperatures and hence advance growth and development. Research was conducted at three on -farm sites near St. John’s in 2000 and 2001 to determine the effects of plastic mulch on time from planting to emergence (VE), 50\% silking (R1), 50\% kernel milk line (R5.5) and dry matter (DM) yield. Three early hybrids with CHU ratings of 2100, 2200 and 2300 were planted in late May of each year when the soil temperature was above 10°C. At planting, half of each plot was covered (PC) with a clear photo-degradable plastic film (X-Tend Plastic System®), 1.32 m in width and 6 m thick, and the other half was not covered (NC). During the first 30–35 d after planting, the crops grew under the thin plastic mulch before breaking through as it started to degrade. During this time, air (10 cm above soil surface) and soil (5 cm depth) temperatures underneath the plastic film were recorded. These were compared to the soil (5 cm depth) and air (100 cm high) temperatures of the NC plots. Soil and air temperatures for PC plots were consistently higher than for NC plots in both years. The plastic continued to degrade during the rest of the season and was completely degraded by the time of harvest in late `September. In 2000, the plastic advanced VE by 9 to 13 d, R1 by 10 to 15 d and R5.5 by 9 to 15 d relative to the NC treatment. In 2001, advancement of VE due to the plastic mulch ranged from 8 and 12 d, 6 to 9 d for R1 and 6 to 11 d for R5.5. Relative to the NC treatment, the plastic improved CHU by 9\% and total DM yield by 22\% in 2000 and improved CHU by 7\% and total DM yield by 14\% in 2001. A small increase in CHU due to plastic mulch resulted in a proportionately larger increase in total DM yield. Plastic mulches have the potential to accelerate maturity thereby insuring silage corn crops achieve acceptable DM yields in cool climate regions such as Newfoundland.

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that polyolefins are bioinert. The last years, a new class of photodegradable polyethylene films with pro-oxidants has been developed, exhibiting optimised operational properties in terms of controlled UV and/or thermal ageing leading to an abrupt, predefined to some extent, rapid fragmentation into very small fragments. These photodegradable or fragmentable polyethylene films are promoted in the market for various commercial applications. In some cases, these materials are presented as, or are claimed to be, biodegradable materials. Such materials are already used in agriculture in the form of photodegradable mulching films which become fragmented into small remains after the end of their useful lifetime and are incorporated into the soil. However, it has not been verified yet beyond any doubt, that these remains do in fact biodegrade in natural soil, under what conditions, at which rate and what are their effects in agricultural production, the soil and the environment. An experimental investigation has been carried out focusing on the combined effects of critical factors on the controlled (predefined) photo-chemical degradation of photodegradable mulching LLDPE films with pro-oxidants and the behaviour of their remains in the soil. The analysis of the photo-chemical degradation behaviour presented in this paper was carried out through parallel experiments performed under real field and controlled laboratory conditions. The main factors investigated include materials, exposure time, temperature and UV radiation.},

  abstract = {The growing use of plastics in agriculture has enabled farmers to increase their crop production. One major drawback of most polymers used in agriculture is the problem with their disposal, following their useful life-time. Non-degradable polymers, being resistive to degradation (depending on the polymer, additives, conditions etc) tend to accumulate as plastic waste, creating a serious problem of plastic waste management. In cases such plastic waste ends-up in landfills or it is buried in soil, questions are raised about their possible effects on the environment, whether they biodegrade at all, and if they do, what is the rate of (bio?)degradation and what effect the products of (bio?)degradation have on the environment, including the effects of the additives used. Possible degradation of agricultural plastic waste should not result in contamination of the soil and pollution of the environment (including aesthetic pollution or problems with the agricultural products safety). Ideally, a degradable polymer should be fully biodegradable leaving no harmful substances in the environment. Most experts and acceptable standards define a fully biodegradable polymer as a polymer that is completely converted by microorganisms to carbon dioxide, water, mineral and biomass, with no negative environmental impact or ecotoxicity. However, part of the ongoing debate concerns the question of what is an acceptable period of time for the biodegradation to occur and how this is measured. Many polymers that are claimed to be ‘biodegradable' are in fact ‘bioerodable', ‘hydrobiodegradable', ‘photodegradable', controlled degradable or just partially biodegradable. This review paper attempts to delineate the definition of degradability of polymers used in agriculture. Emphasis is placed on the controversial issues regarding biodegradability of some of these polymers.},

The aim of this work was to replicate a method for microplastic analysis in beer. Several methodological pitfalls were detected in the literature method, including the staining agent rose bengal used in microscopic analysis, which false-negatively excludes some synthetic agents including the beer filtration aid polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP). False positive results may occur for non-plastic compounds such as starch or kieselgur. Other pitfalls in the analysis include the considerable background contamination, which did not allow differentiation between beer samples from blank samples in our laboratory. Specialized cleanrooms are required, but even then contamination may occur, because cleanroom classifications focus on small particles and may exclude the relevant sizes of microplastic particles. We judge the previous nonvalidated literature methods that reported positive findings in foods as unsuitable for the purpose of microplastic identification and believe that the results were artefacts due to contamination. Especially because beer production includes a microfiltration step to remove yeast cells, microplastic contamination due to raw materials is highly unlikely. So far, a validated methodology for microplastic detection in foods or beverages is unavailable.},

  abstract = {Occurrence and distribution of microplastics in different ecosystems have recently become subjects of numerous studies. However, to date the research has focused mainly on marine and freshwater ecosystems and widely neglected terrestrial environments. Only recently, first studies investigated the microplastics contamination of soils. Therefore, we know little about the transport mechanisms of microplastics in soils and sediments and virtually nothing about their surface transport. In this study we investigate surface transport mechanisms by tracking fluorescent, irregularly shaped polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particles in real time in a laboratory setup. In 108 experimental runs, we vary the irrigation rates, inclinations and surface roughnesses. Additionally, we simulate the small-scale flow patterns to resolve the role of the roughness-induced microrelief. Our results suggest that microplastics are transported along preferential pathways resulting from the micro- and macrorelief, which can be correlated to the flow pattern observed in the computer simulation. Our model study facilitates a deeper insight into microplastic transport on different soil surfaces and serves as a pilot for investigating mechanisms of horizontal microplastic transport. However, microplastics are a diverse group of contaminants with varying shapes, densities and sizes. Therefore, for a full understanding of transport of microplastics in terrestrial environments, it is important to address these properties as well as more variable surfaces for horizontal migration and to include vertical transport mechanisms in future research.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial environments are subject to extensive pollution by plastics and, based on the slow degradation of plastics, are likely to act as long term sinks for microplastic debris. Currently the hazards of microplastics in soil and the potential impacts on soil organisms is poorly understood. Particularly the role of particle characteristics, such a size or polymer type, in dose-response relationships for microplastics is not known. The aim of this study was to assess the ingestion and toxicity of nylon (polyamide) particles, in three different size ranges, to Enchytraeus crypticus in a soil exposure. Effects were also compared with those of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles, in a single size range. Nylon particle ingestion was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy, with greatest ingestion for particles in the smallest size range (13–18 μm). To investigate how particle size affected survival and reproduction, E.~crypticus were exposed to nylon particles in two well-defined size ranges (13–18 and 90–150 μm) and concentrations of 20, 50, 90 and 120 g/kg (2–12\% w/w). An intermediate nylon size range (63–90 μm) and a larger sized PVC particle (106–150 μm), both at 90 g/kg, were also tested. Survival was not affected by either of the polymer types or sizes. Reproduction was significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, by the nylon particles at high exposure concentrations ({$>$}90 g/kg). Smaller size ranges (13–18 μm) had a greater effect compared to larger size ranges ({$>$}63 μm), with a calculated EC50 for the 13–18 μm size range of 108 ± 8.5 g/kg. This greater hazard could be qualitatively linked with the ingestion of a greater number of smaller particles. This study highlights the potential for toxic effects of plastics in small size ranges to soil organisms at high exposure concentrations, providing understanding of the hazards microplastics may pose in the terrestrial environment.},

SOM is a source of atmospheric CO2, with the use of extractive farming practices that lead to a negative nutrient balance and exacerbate soil degradation. The historic loss of C from the SOM pool between the 1850s and 2000 is estimated at 78 ± 12 Gt compared with the emission of 270 ± 30 Gt from fossil fuel combustion. Despite its numerous direct and ancillary benefits, enhancing the SOM pool is a major challenge, especially in impoverished and depleted soils in harsh tropical climates. In addition to biophysical factors, there are also numerous social, economic and political constraints that limit increase in SOM pools. Conversion of plough-tillage to no-till farming, an important practice to enhance the SOM pool, is constrained by the limited access to herbicides and seed drill, and the competing uses of crop residues. Yet, enhancing the SOM pool is essential to restoring degraded soils, advancing food security and improving the environment. Important subjects among researchable topics include: assessing the rate of SOM accretion for a wide range of land use and management practices with reference to a baseline; evaluating the importance of biochar; measuring and predicting SOM at landscape and extrapolation to regional scale; establishing relationships between SOM and soil quality and agronomic productivity; determining on- and off-site effects of crop residues removal for ethanol/biofuel production; determining the fate of C in SOM translocated by erosional processes; evaluating nutrient requirements for increasing SOM in croplands; validating predictive models in tropical environments; and developing methodology for trading C credits.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is a global issue because of its severe adverse economic and environmental impacts. Economic impacts on productivity may be due to direct effects on crops/plants on-site and off-site, and environmental consequences are primarily off-site due either to pollution of natural waters or adverse effects on air quality due to dust and emissions of radiatively active gases. Off-site economic effects of erosion are related to the damage to civil structure, siltation of water ways and reservoirs, and additional costs involved in water treatment. There are numerous reports regarding the on-site effects of erosion on productivity. However, a vast majority of these are from the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Europe, and only a few from soils of the tropics and subtropics. On-site effects of erosion on agronomic productivity are assessed with a wide range of methods, which can be broadly grouped into three categories: agronomic/soil quality evaluation, economic assessment, and knowledge surveys. Agronomic methods involve greenhouse and field experiments to assess erosion-induced changes in soil quality in relation to productivity. A widely used technique is to establish field plots on the same soil series but with different severity of past erosion. Different erosional phases must be located on the same landscape position. Impact of past erosion on productivity can also be assessed by relating plant growth to the depth of a root-restrictive horizon. Impact of current erosion rate on productivity can be assessed using field runoff plots or paired watersheds, and that of future erosion using topsoil removal and addition technique. Economic evaluation of the on-site impact involves assessment of the losses of plant available water and nutrients and other additional inputs needed due to erosion. Knowledge surveys are conducted as a qualitative substitute for locations where quantitative data are not available. Results obtained from these different techniques are not comparable, and there is a need to standardize the methods and develop scaling procedures to extrapolate the data from plot or soil level to regional and global scale. There is also a need to assess on-site impact of erosion in relation to soil loss tolerance, soil life, soil resilience or ease of restoration, and soil management options for sustainable use of soil and water resources. Restoration of degraded soils is a high global priority. If about 1.5×109 ha of soils in the world prone to erosion can be managed to effectively control soil erosion, it would improve air and water quality, sequester C in the pedosphere at the rate of about 1.5 Pg/year, and increase food production. The risks of global annual loss of food production due to accelerated erosion may be as high as 190×106 Mg of cereals, 6×106 Mg of soybeans, 3×106 Mg of pulses, and 73×106 Mg of roots and tubers. The actual loss may depend on weather conditions during the growing season, farming systems, soil management, and soil ameliorative input used. Erosion-caused losses of food production are most severe in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere in the tropics rather than in other regions.},

  abstract = {Accelerated erosion involves preferential removal of soil organic carbon (SOC) because it is concentrated in vicinity of the soil surface and has lower density than the mineral fraction. The SOC transported by water runoff is redistributed over the landscape and deposited in depressional sites where it is buried along with the sediments. However, the fate of the SOC transported, redistributed and deposited by erosional processes is a subject of intense debate. Sedimentologists argue that SOC buried with sediments is physically protected, and that depleted in the eroded soil is replaced through biomass production. Thus, they argue that the erosion–sedimentation process leads to globally net SOC sequestration of 0.6–1.5GtC/year. In contrast, soil scientists argue that: (i) a large portion of the SOC transported by water runoff comprises labile fraction, (ii) breakdown of aggregation by raindrop impact and shearing force of runoff accentuates mineralization of the previously protected organic matter, and (iii) the SOC within the plow zone at the depositional sites may be subject to rapid mineralization, along with methanogenesis and denitrification under anaerobic environment. Whereas, tillage erosion may also cause burial of some SOC, increase in soil erosion and emission of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion are net sources of atmospheric CO2. Soil scientists argue that soil erosion may be a net source of atmospheric CO2 with emission of 1GtC/year. It is thus important to understand the fate of eroded SOC by measuring and monitoring SOC pool in eroded landscape as influenced by intensity and frequency of tillage operations and cropping systems.},

Each of the plastics used exhibited a measureable increase in the release of particles into the surrounding solution, with polystyrene (PS) and polylactic acid (PLA) generating the highest particle concentrations. After 112~d, particle concentrations ranged from 2147 particles ml−1 in the control (C) to 92,465 particles ml−1 for PS in the 2–60~μm size class; 1.2~×~105 particles ml−1 (C) to 11.6~×~106 for PLA in the 0.6–18~μm size class; and 0.2~×~108 particles ml−1 (C) to 6.4~×~108 particles ml−1 for PS in the 30–2000~nm size class (84~d). A classification of samples based on principal component analysis showed a separation between the different plastic types, with PLA clustering individually in each of the three size classes. In addition, particle size distribution models were used to examine more closely the size distribution data generated by NTA. Overall, the results indicate that at the beginning of plastic weathering processes chain scission at the polymer surface causes many very small particles to be released into the surrounding solution and those concentrations may vary between plastic types.},

The term ‘contaminant of emerging concern’ does not only apply to chemical pollutants but to MPs as well because it has been detected ubiquitously in freshwater systems. The environmental release of MPs will occur from a wide variety of sources, including emissions from wastewater treatment plants and from the degradation of larger plastic debris items. Due to the chemical makeup of plastic materials, receiving environments are potentially exposed to a mixture of micro- and nano-sized particles, leached additives, and subsequent degradation products, which will become bioavailable for a range of biota. The ingestion of MPs by aquatic organisms has been demonstrated, but the long-term effects of continuous exposures are less well understood. Technological developments and changes in demographics will influence the types of MPs and environmental concentrations in the future, and it will be important to develop approaches to mitigate the input of synthetic polymers to freshwater ecosystems.},

  abstract = {At a global scale, increasing human population and associated economic growth has lead to an increase in the demand for consumable goods such as those made from polymer-based materials (PBMs) (i.e., plastics and elastomers). During their lifecycle PBMs can be released into the environment from a variety of sources. Once in the environment, PBMs are exposed to a variety of mechanical and chemical weathering processes. This causes a change to the PBM structure and facilitates the disintegration of the PBM into increasingly smaller fragments (Andrady 2011). Furthermore these materials are now thought to be contributing to the build-up of chemicals in the environment via the leaching of chemical additives that are used in the manufacturing process (Erren et al. 2009). The majority of physical effects data regarding bulk PBM items identifies them as presenting a hazard to mammals and birds as they can become entangled and/or mistake PBMs as a food source (Derraik 2002). The majority of ecotoxicity data regarding PBM additives has focused on the effects of compounds that are generally referred to as having endocrine disruptive potential, such as the phthalates (Oehlmann et al. 2009). However, receiving environments are potentially exposed to a combination of both these physical and chemical components, as well as substances produced during degradation processes. Therefore, PBMs and their associated degradation products may compromise the viability of organisms at all trophic levels. At the base of the food chain primary producers may be more sensitive to substances that have a biological action. Nonselective and filter-feeding consumers could be susceptible to ingesting both bulk PBMs and fragmented particles, leading to the potential passage up the food chain to secondary and tertiary consumers. Despite this concern, PBMs are regarded under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) as representing a low environmental concern because of their high molecular weight (ECHA 2012). However, the occurrence of PBMs and their associated chemical additives in the aquatic environment have been recognized as an emerging worldwide problem, and their impacts are now gaining a wider scientific and social audience (Hammer et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2009).},

  abstract = {For centuries horticulturists have attempted to modify the environment in which vegetable crops are grown. A wide variety of techniques, such as glass cloches, hotcaps, cold frames, hotbeds, and various types of glass greenhouses, have been used to extend the production season. The discovery and development of the polyethylene polymer in the late 1930s, and its subsequent introduction in the early 1950s in the form of plastic films, mulches, and drip-irrigation tubing and tape, revolutionized the commercial production of selected vegetable crops and gave rise to a system of production known as plasticulture. Simply defined, plasticulture is a system of growing vegetable crops where significant benefit is derived from using products derived from polyethylene (plastic) polymers. The later discovery of other polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and polyesters, and their use in microirrigation systems, pipes, fertigation equipment, filters, fittings and connectors, containers for growing transplants, picking and packaging containers, and row covers further extended the use of plastic components in this production system. The complete plasticulture system consists of plastic and non-plastic components: plastic mulches, drip-irrigation, fertigation/chemigation, soil sanitation (fumigation and solarization), windbreaks, stand establishment technology, season-extension technology, integrated pest management, cropping strategies, and postharvest handling and marketing. In the plasticulture system, plastic-covered greenhouses, plastic mulches, row covers, high tunnels, and windbreaks both permanent and annual are the major contributors to modifying the cropping environment of vegetable crops, thus enhancing crop growth, yield, and quality. In addition to modifying the soil and air temperatures, there are also the benefits of protection from the wind and in some instances rain, insects, diseases, and vertebrate pests.},

Solvent extraction of MPs followed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) provides data that not only regard the soluble plastics, but also the organic additives contained in MPs and the low-molecular weight degradation products of insoluble plastics. In this study, the potential of microwave-assisted solvent extraction and double-shot Py-GC-MS was investigated in order to obtain quali-quantitative information on polystyrene and on phthalate plasticizers in environmental samples. The method was validated and provided recoveries higher than 96\%, and detection limits lower than 1\,ng and 1\,μg for phthalates and polystyrene, respectively. We used the method to analyse samples of sand collected from a shoreline in Tuscany (central Italy) and thereby determine the content of phthalate and polystyrene at different depths and distances from the coastline. Qualitative data were also obtained regarding the presence of oxidation products derived from polyethylene and polypropylene. The different contents of plasticizers, plastics, and degradation products in the investigated samples are discussed in relation to how environmental agents affect the leaching and degradation processes of the polymers.},

  abstract = {Environmental pollution from microplastics (MPs) and the associated health and environmental risks are the focus of intense multidisciplinary research. In fact, that there is an urgent need to produce quantitative and qualitative data on the amount and types of MPs in environmental matrices, organisms, and commodities, and to perform spatial and temporal comparisons. This has led to the development, optimization and application of analytical methods to characterize MPs in aquatic, terrestrial or biological samples. Instrumental analytical techniques based on analytical pyrolysis and thermal analyses provide qualitative and mass-based quantitative information and have a high potential to become of general use in the analysis of MPs. This paper reviews the research carried out to date in the analysis of MPs by analytical thermal and pyrolysis techniques. The aim is to provide a detailed and comprehensive critical examination of recent quantitative analysis developments, integrated with a brief historical excursus. The main analytical issues and limitations are described with practical detail, to provide an overview of the rapid ongoing development of this sector of analytical chemistry, and to contribute to the activities aimed at evaluating, comparing and standardising analytical techniques and analytical data in MP research.},

  abstract = {Compared with pristine agricultural polyethylene (PE) soil films microplastics (MPs), aged agricultural polyethylene (APE) soil films MPs have a rougher surface, more cracks and have some oxygen-containing functional groups that makes them adsorb organic pollutants, such as pesticides more easily. This may be more harmful to human beings than marine MPs as the agricultural soil films are closer to our living environment. But few works focused on the adsorption of pesticides on pristine or aged agricultural polyethylene soil films MPs. In order to promote the risk assessment of co-exposure of pesticides and agricultural polyethylene soil films MPs, a comparative study on the adsorption behavior and mechanism of four pesticides (carbendazim, diflubenzuron, malathion, difenoconazole) by pristine PE MPs and APE MPs were carried out in this paper. The results showed microcracks and surface oxidation observed on APE MPs. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm models indicated that the adsorption capacity of APE MPs was higher than that of PE MPs, which attribute to the larger surface area of APE MPs. The adsorption capacities of pesticides on APE MPs were positively correlated with LogKow (Water octanol partition coefficient) values of these four pesticides, showed the hydrophobic partitioning played the most important part in the adsorption, but also some H-bonding between secondary amines in the molecular of diflubenzuron and polar O-containing functional groups on APE MPs may be formed. And electrostatic forces or interactions are not the determining factor for these pesticides adsorption behavior of PE MPs, and the effect of pH is mainly driven by changes in sorbate properties rather than changes in surface properties of MPs. The results presented herein show the APE MPs can be a better vector of most hydrophobic pesticides than pristine MPs in the agricultural field, and more attention should be paid to the problem of films and pesticides residue in farmland soil.},

Furthermore, in the related literature, the used procedures are rarely tested with spiked microplastics to predetermine their recovery rates. Without this knowledge, results should only be discussed as rough estimations of the real environmental concentrations of microplastics. In this study, six different methods previously used in microplastic studies of different media were tested with municipal wastewater and digested sludge samples, spiked with seven different types of plastic particles and fibres. Recovery rates, time consumption, advantages and disadvantages were assessed and most suitable treatment procedures (i.e. high recovery rates in short amount of time) were chosen for both wastewater and sludge. Suitability of staining with Rose Bengal was examined together with most efficient methods, but it did not improve the recovery of microplastics. In addition, the possible impacts of the treatments for identification with micro-Raman and FTIR microscope were assessed. Filtration with size fractioning was found to be the best method for both wastewater and sludge samples, with recovery rates of spiked microplastics around 91.4\% and 92.9\%, respectively.},

The WWTP was operated based on the conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscope and Raman microscope. Overall, the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied WWTP was found to be 98.3\%. Most of the MP fraction was removed before the activated sludge process. The efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology was also examined. The main related finding is that MBR permeate contained 0.4 MP/L in comparison with the final effluent of the CAS process (1.0 MP/L). According to this study, both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged from the WWTP to the aquatic environment.},

The increasing number of reports reveal the micro- and nanosized plastic fragments at almost every place on earth from the ocean bottom to the mountain top. MPs were also found in many living species, including humans. The omnipresence of MPs had put on the agenda the necessity of joint efforts aimed at controlling the volumes of production, limiting the single-use goods, encouraging responsible consumption, and improving waste management. MPs are very stable and degrading too slowly to rely on the natural self-cleansing capacity of the environment. This review describes the growing efforts in the development of efficient methods for removal, stimulated degradation, and recycling of MPs. The practiced approaches to the extraction of MPs from water probes, techniques for identification of polymer types, strategies for the stimulated natural and artificial degradation of the material are thoroughly discussed. The inquiry concludes with an overview of trends in the recycling of MPs and pollution control.

Poly(4-fluorostyrene) (PFS) is a promising alternative, which does not suffer from exchange reactions and can cover a larger concentration range. Both standards yielded comparable results in calibrations for polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene MP, but a larger concentration range could be covered if PFS was used. Only minor interferences of both polymers with natural organic matrix components were observed.

Five National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) were analyzed. This is the first report of OPAH quantitation in SRM 2977 (mussel tissue), SRM 1944 (New York/New Jersey, USA waterway sediment), SRM 1975 (diesel extract), and SRM 1650b (diesel particulate matter) and among the few to report concentrations from SRM 1649 (urban dust). Furthermore, this is one of the first reports of OPAHs in biological tissue. Σ9OPAHs were 374 ± 59 mg/kg (mussel tissue), 5.4 ± 0.5 mg/kg (sediment), 16.9 ± 1.6 mg/kg (urban dust), 33.4 ± 0.4 mg/kg (diesel extract), and 150 ± 43 mg/kg (diesel particulate matter). In all SRMs, the levels of OPAHs were similar to or exceeded levels of PAHs. Of the OPAHs tested, the most frequently occurring in the environmental matrices were 9-fluorenone, 9,10-anthraquinone, benzofluorenone, and 7,12-benz[a]anthracenequinone. Environ. Toxicol.

It is assumed that low resolution GC/MS provides adequate and reliable results in the majority of cases dealing with priority pollutants and other volatile and semivolatile compounds. As environmental issues become more and more important in modern society and new generations of high resolution and high mass accuracy mass spectrometers become available, it is quite reasonable to expect improvements in sensitivity, reliability and quantity of information provided by GC/MS analyses. This article demonstrates the advantages of high resolution GC/MS for qualitative and quantitative environmental analyses including targeted and non-targeted approaches as well as de novo structural elucidation of analytes not present in commercial libraries. Most of the examples presented here involve the GC/MS analysis of snow samples collected in 2012 and 2013 in Moscow, Russia.},

Knowing with precision where litter is generated is important to target priority areas for the implementation of mitigation policies. In this study, using country-level data on waste management combined with high-resolution distributions and long-term projections of population and the gross domestic product (GDP), we present projections of global MPW generation at \textasciitilde 1\,km resolution from now to 2060. We estimated between 60 and 99 million metric tonnes (Mt) of MPW were produced globally in 2015. In a business-as-usual scenario, this figure could triple to 155–265\,Mt\,y−1 by 2060. The future MPW load will continue to be disproportionately high in African and Asian continents even in the future years. However, we show that this growth in plastic waste can be reduced if developing economies significantly invest in waste management infrastructures as their GDP grows in the future and if efforts are made internationally to reduce the fraction of plastic in municipal solid waste. Using our projections, we also demonstrate that the majority of MPW (91\%) are transported via watersheds larger than 100\,km2 suggesting that rivers are major pathways for plastic litter to the ocean.},

  abstract = {This study was carried out to maximize the fertilization efficiency of mixed organic fertilizer (OF) for organically managed onion (Allium cepa L.) production during the one growing season of 2005–2006. The organic fertilizer was made of organic materials like sesame oil cake, rice bran and molasses and minerals like illite and mountainous soil. Four organic topdressing treatments, which all followed the same basal fertilization with solid OF, consisted of solid OF without mulch (OF/OFnM), liquid organic fertilizer without mulch (OF/LOFnM), liquid organic fertilizer under mulch (OF/LOFuM) and liquid organic fertilizer over mulch (OF/LOFoM). Chemical fertilizer (CF) and no fertilizer (NF) were treated as controls. The solid organic fertilization base was 2.0 ton ha−1, and 4.57 ton ha−1 and was used for topdressing. The total amount of liquid organic fertilization was 133.2 ton ha−1, which was divided into 6 applications from February through March. The OF/LOFuM and OF/LOFoM topdressings did not reduce onion height, leaf number or bulb diameter as compared to chemical fertilizer, whereas no mulch treatments made onion growth significantly poorer. Onion top weight in CF was significantly higher than that in OF groups at the peak growth stage, while there was not much difference in bulb weight between the CF and OF/LOFoM treatment. Finally, the onion marketable yield was 45.9 ton ha−1 in the OF/LOFoM treatment, which exceeded that in the CF treatment by up to 1.9 ton. Furthermore, OF/LOFoM was the most effective among all the treatments in transferring the nutrients from sink to source. CF made the soil pH more acidic than OF did, and the electrical conductivity (EC) remained higher with CF than OF as well. While organic fertilizer helped to keep the NO3-N content stable throughout the growing season, the concentration rapidly oscillated up and down according to CF fertilization. Organic fertilizer increased population number of soil microorganisms like aerobes, actinomycetes in the field.},

Replicate determinations (n = 5), on the same tobacco and using n-heptadecane as the internal standard, resulted in a nicotine content of 1.96\%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.9\%. This result was in good agreement with those from established methods:\, the Cai ether extraction method, a chloroform extraction method, and the CORESTA recommended method. However, the DSP method requires less than half the time of the solvent extraction methods, requires less sample, is almost solvent-free, and is less labor-intensive. The DSP method was used to determine the nicotine content of eight flue-cured tobaccos from Brazil, China, Korea, and the United States, which were found to have contents ranging from 1.21 to 2.19\%.

We prepared a wettability gradient on low density polyethylene (PE) sheets by treating them in air with the corona from a knife-type electrode whose power increases gradually along the sample length. The PE surfaces oxidized gradually with the increasing corona power, and the wettability gradient was created on the surfaces as evidenced by the measurement of water contact angles, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflectance mode, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. The wettability gradient surfaces prepared were used to investigate the interaction of different types of cells (Chinese hamster ovary, fibroblast, and endothelial cells) as well as serum proteins in terms of the surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of polymeric materials. The cells adhered and grown on the gradient surface along the sample length were counted and observed by scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that the cells were adhered, spread, and grown more onto the positions with moderate hydrophilicity of the wettability gradient surface than onto the more hydrophobic or hydrophilic positions. The maximum adhesion and growth of the cells appeared at around water contact angles of 55°, regardless of the cell types used. This result seems closely related to the serum protein adsorption on the surfaces; the serum proteins were also adsorbed more onto the positions with moderate hydrophilicity of the wettability gradient surface.},

In this study, biological STF using the anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A2O), sequence batch reactor (SBR), and the Media processes were investigated to confirm the efficiency of these treatments and the associated amounts of microplastics released for each process. The three investigated processes were found to have treatment efficiencies of about 98\% or more. However, due to the large amount of effluent, more than four billion pieces of microplastic were released each year in each facility. Thus, even though biological STF show high treatment efficiencies, substantially large amounts of microplastics are still released into the marine environment.},

The consequences of the presence of plastics for soils, including soil biota and the processes they drive, are largely unknown. This is particularly true for microplastic. There is only little data available on the effect of microplastics on key soil processes, including soil aggregation. Here, we investigated the consequences of polyester microfiber contamination on soil aggregation of a sandy soil under laboratory conditions. We aimed to test if the microfiber effects on soil aggregation were predominantly physical or biological. We found that soil biota addition (compared to sterile soil) had a significant positive effect on both the formation and stabilization of soil aggregates, as expected, while wet-dry cycles solely affected aggregate formation. Polyester microfiber contamination did not affect the formation and stability of aggregates. But in the presence of soil biota, microfibers reduced soil aggregate stability. Our results show that polyester microfibers have the potential to alter soil structure, and that these effects are at least partially mediated by soil biota.},

  abstract = {With respect to carbon sequestration in soil, attempts have been made to identify soil organic matter (SOM) fractions that respond more rapidly to changes in land-use than bulk SOM, which could thus serve as early indicators for the overall stock change. We used a combination of physical fractionation (size and density separation) and chemical characterisation (C-to-N ratios, CuO lignin signature, 13C NMR spectroscopy) to identify sensitive SOM fractions in an agricultural system with sandy dystric cambisols in Bavaria, Germany, 7 years after a land-use change. Land-use types included long-term arable land and grassland, and conversion from one system to the other. Soil carbon and nitrogen contents in 0–3 cm increased from 14 to 39 mg organic carbon g−1 soil, and from 1.7 to 3.9 mg nitrogen g−1 soil in the following order: permanent arable, conversion grassland to arable, conversion arable to grassland, and permanent grassland. Wet sieving and ultrasonic dispersion with 22 J ml−1 released \&lt;5\% and 60\% to 80\%, respectively, of the amount of particles \&gt;20 μm relative to complete dispersion. The most sensitive fraction, with respect to land-use, was SOM in the fraction \&gt;20 μm not released after sequential wet sieving and ultrasonic dispersion. In contrast, the proportion of free light (wet sieving, density \&lt;1.8 g cm−3) and occluded light (ultrasonic dispersion with 22 J ml−1, \&lt;1.8 g cm−3) particulate organic matter (POM) showed no clear response to land-use. The structural composition of POM indicated its vegetation origin with a selective enrichment of lignin and a loss of O-alkyl C relative to its plant precursors. Decomposition of the occluded light POM was only slightly advanced relative to the free light POM. In mineral fractions \&lt;20 μm, SOM was significantly more transformed than in the coarse fractions, as shown by NMR spectroscopy; however, it revealed no specific land-use pattern. An exception to this was the proportion of O-alkyl C in the clay fraction, which increased with SOC content. Ratios of alkyl to O-alkyl C in mineral fractions \&lt;20 μm differentiated samples gave a better differentiation of samples than the C-to-N ratios. We conclude that neither free nor occluded light POM are appropriate early indicators for changes in land-use at the investigated sites; however, total SOM, its distribution with depth, and SOM allocated in stable aggregates \&gt;20 μm were more sensitive.},

Bisherige Ergebnisse haben gezeigt, dass die Form der Mikroplastikpartikel eine wichtige Rolle spielt: Insbesondere Fasern scheinen negative Auswirkungen auf Bodenprozesse wie die Bodenaggregation zu haben, also das Zusammenhalten von Bodenpartikeln in Aggregaten und deren Stabilität. Möglicherweise stören die Mikroplastikpartikel den Zusammenhalt der Aggregate durch das Einfügen von Sollbruchstellen. Fragmente wie Folienstücke oder Kügelchen hatten bisher unterschiedlich starke Effekte auf Bodenprozesse. In mehreren Versuchen wurde experimentell gezeigt, dass Regenwürmer in Mitleidenschaft gezogen wurden und die Aktivität der mikrobiellen Bodenlebensgemeinschaft verändert wird. Die Keimung von Samen kann negativ beeinflusst werden; das Wachstum von Pflanzen wurde in Laborversuchen sowohl positiv als auch negativ beeinflusst. Die unterschiedlichen Versuchsergebnisse sind in erster Linie vermutlich auf die immens große Zahl an unterschiedlichen Plastikarten, deren Zusatzstoffen und Versuchsbedingungen zurückzuführen.

  abstract = {Microplastics are ubiquitously found in terrestrial ecosystems and are increasingly recognized as a factor of global change (GCF). Current research shows that microplastic can alter plant growth, soil inherent properties and the composition and activity of microbial communities. However, knowledge about how microplastic affects arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is scarce. For plants it has been shown that microplastic can both increase and decrease the aboveground biomass and reduce the root diameter, which could indirectly cause a change in AMF abundance and activity. One of the main direct effects of microplastic is the reduction of the soil bulk density, which translates to an altered soil pore structure and water transport. Moreover, especially fibers can have considerable impacts on soil structure, namely the size distribution and stability of soil aggregates. Therefore, microplastic alters a number of soil parameters that determine habitat space and conditions for AMF. We expect that this will influence functions mediated by AMF, such as soil aggregation, water and nutrient transport. We discuss how the impacts of microplastic on AMF could alter how plants deal with other GCFs in the context of sustainable food production. The co-occurrence of several GCFs, e.g. elevated temperature, drought, pesticides and microplastic could modify the impact of microplastic on AMF. Furthermore, the ubiquitous presence of microplastic also relates to earth system processes, e.g. net primary production, carbon and nitrogen cycling, which involve AMF as key soil organisms. For future research, we outline which experiments should be prioritized.},

  abstract = {(Nano)microplastics (N/MPs) are emerging contaminants of increasing concern. However, little is known about the potential toxicity difference between nanoplastics and microplastics on organisms. In this study, we investigated the effects of polystyrene N/MPs with diameter sizes of 100 and 500 nm at the nanoscale and 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 μm at the microscale on the survival, lifespan, motor behavior, movement-related neurons and oxidative stress in Caenorhabditis elegans. After 3 days of exposure to 1.0 mg L−1 polystyrene particles of the five sizes, the 1.0 μm group had the lowest survival rate, the largest decrease in body length and the shortest average lifespan in nematodes. We demonstrated that exposure to N/MPs accelerated the frequency of body bending and head thrashing, and increased crawling speed, which indicate that N/MPs can induce size-dependent excitatory toxicity on locomotor behavior. Of the five sizes of N/MPs, 1.0 μm particles significantly downregulated the expression of unc-17 and unc-47, and resulted in obvious damage to cholinergic and GABAergic neurons. We also found that polystyrene N/MPs significantly elevated the expression of gst-4, which encodes glutathione S-transferase-4, a key enzyme in oxidative stress. Additionally, N/MPs-induced oxidative damage was effectively attenuated by natural antioxidants, curcumin and oligometric proanthocyanidins. Taken together, these findings suggest that (nano)microplastics can exert size-dependent toxicity and have extensive impacts on organisms.},

MP ≥10μm diameter filtered from below the sea surface in the European and subtropical North Atlantic were simultaneously identified by visual microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy. Visually identified particles below 100μm had a significantly lower percentage confirmed by Raman than larger ones indicating that visual identification alone is inappropriate for studies on small microplastics. Sixty-eight percent of visually counted MP (n=1279) were spectroscopically confirmed being plastic. The percentage varied with type, colour and size of the MP. Fibres had a higher success rate (75\%) than particles (64\%). We tested Raman micro-spectroscopy applicability for MP identification with respect to varying chemical composition (additives), degradation state and organic matter coating. Partially UV-degraded post-consumer plastics provided identifiable Raman spectra for polymers most common among marine MP, i.e. polyethylene and polypropylene.},

The production of bioenergy and biomaterials can sustain the energy–environment nexus as well as substitute the devoid of petroleum as the production feedstock, thereby contributing to a cleaner and low carbon environment. In addition, assimilation of waste into bioprocesses for the production of useful products and metabolites lead towards a sustainable circular bioeconomy. This review aims to highlight~the waste biorefinery as a sustainable bio-based circular economy, and, therefore, promoting a greener environment. Several case studies on the bioprocesses utilising waste for biopolymers and bio-lipids production as well as bioprocesses incorporated with wastewater treatment are well discussed. The strategy of waste biorefinery integrated with circular bioeconomy in the perspectives of unravelling the global issues can help to tackle carbon management and greenhouse gas emissions. A waste biorefinery–circular bioeconomy strategy represents a low carbon economy by reducing greenhouse gases footprint, and holds great prospects for a sustainable~and greener world.},

  abstract = {Environmental contamination by plastic particles, also known as ‘microplastics’, brings synthetic materials that are non-degradable and biologically incompatible into contact with ecosystems. In this paper we present concentration data for this emerging contaminant in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and freshwater and marine systems, reflecting the routes via which these particles can travel and the ecosystems they potentially impact along their path. Raw sewage influents, effluents and sewage sludge from seven municipal WWTPs in the Netherlands contained mean particle concentrations of 68–910L−1, 51–81L−1 and 510–760kg−1 wet weight (ww), respectively (particle sizes between 10 and 5000μm). Even after treatment, wastewater constitutes a source of microplastic pollution of surface waters, and via biosolids applications in farming and forestry, plastic retained in sewage sludge can be transferred to terrestrial environments. The WWTPs investigated here had a mean microplastics retention efficiency of 72\% (s.d. 61\%) in the sewage sludge. In the receiving waters of treated and untreated wastewaters, we detected high microplastic levels in riverine suspended particulate matter (1400–4900kg−1 dry weight (dw)) from the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Amsterdam canal water sampled at different urban locations contained microplastic concentrations (48–187L−1), similar to those observed in wastewater that is emitted from sewage treatment facilities in the area. At least partial settling of the particles occurs in freshwater as well, as indicated by microplastics in urban canal sediments ({$<$}68 to 10,500particleskg−1dw). Microplastics in suspension in the water column have the potential to be discharged into the sea with other riverine suspended particulates. We report microplastic concentrations from 100 up to 3600particleskg−1 dry sediment collected at 15 locations along the Dutch North Sea coast. The high microplastic enrichment in marine sediments compared to most literature data for seawater at the surface supports the hypothesis of a seabed sink for these materials. Marine species are heavily exposed to plastic particles. Body residues between 10 and 100particlesg−1dw were measured in benthic macroinvertebrate species inhabiting the Dutch North Sea coast: filter-feeding mussels and oysters (species for human consumption) as well as other consumers in the marine food chain.},

As these affect the landscape visually, increase pollution and decrease local biodiversity, better monitoring and planning of their uses and areas are needed. Using a field spectrometer we studied the spectral properties of a sample of polyethylene sheets and various nets used in Israel. We detected three major absorption features around 1218 nm, 1732 nm and 2313 nm. These were not affected by settling dust, whitewashing or by the underlying surface, but were not apparent in black coloured polyethylene sheets or nets. A hyperspectral AISA-ES image with a spatial resolution of I in achieved a detection accuracy of above 90\% for bright sheets and nets but of only 70\% for the black nets. The best spectral feature for plastic mapping was found to be that around 1732nm as it does not coincide with spectral features of other minerals, soils, vegetation or atmospheric attenuation. As most of the greenhouses patches in Israel are smaller than 3200 m, the optimal spatial resolution of a sensor for mapping them should be equal or better than 8-16 m. As a result of their low spectral and spatial resolution, Landsat images proved inadequate for mapping greenhouses, and strengthen the need of hyperspectral technology for that end.},

However, little information is currently available concerning the influence of MPs derived from PCF (PCF-MPs) on the crop-soil system. Therefore, we investigated the impacts of PCF-MPs (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1\% w/w) on the growth of maize cultivars (ZNT 488 \& ZTN 182), rhizosphere metabolites, microbial community, and soil properties. The effects of PCF-MPs on plant growth varied with plant cultivars and exposure doses. MPs had no influence on the growth of ZNT 488, but significantly improved the plant performance of ZTN 182~at higher doses. PCF-MPs insignificantly altered the rhizosphere metabolite profile of two maize cultivars. Although soil PAEs contents and the microbial communities were unchanged, the phyla Fibrobacteres and Verrucomicrobia (associated with plant growth-promotion) were increased significantly in ZTN 182. Moreover, PCF-MPs stimulated the soil urease, acid phosphatase and nitrate reductase activities, especially the phytase activity in ZTN 182. Besides, significant alterations in soil properties were also discovered in a cultivar-dependent manner. Overall, our study highlighted that the potential environmental risk assessment of PCF-MPs is still needed, even though PCF-MPs did not show negative effect on maize growth and rhizosphere metabolic profiles.},

  abstract = {Microplastic as an anthropogenic pollutant accumulates in terrestrial ecosystems over time, threatening soil quality and health, for example by decreasing aggregate stability. Organic matter addition is an efficient approach to promote aggregate stability, yet little is known about whether microplastic can reduce the beneficial effect of organic matter on aggregate stability. We investigated the impacts of microplastic fibers in the presence or absence of different organic materials by carrying out a soil incubation experiment. This experiment was set up as a fully factorial design containing all combinations of microplastic fibers (no microplastic fiber addition, two different types of polyester fibers, and polyacrylic) and organic matter (no organic matter addition, Medicago lupulina leaves, Plantago lanceolata leaves, wheat straw, and hemp stems). We evaluated the percentage of water-stable aggregates (WSA) and activities of four soil enzymes (β-glucosidase, β-D-celluliosidase, N-acetyl-b-glucosaminidase, phosphatase). Organic matter addition increased WSA and enzyme activities, as expected. In particular, Plantago or wheat straw addition increased WSA and enzyme activities by 224.77\% or 281.65 \% and 298.51\% or 55.45\%, respectively. Microplastic fibers had no effect on WSA and enzyme activities in the soil without organic matter addition, but decreased WSA and enzyme activities by 26.20\% or 37.57 \% and 23.85\% or 26.11\%, respectively, in the presence of Plantago or wheat straw. Our study shows that the effects of microplastic fibers on soil aggregation and enzyme activities are organic matter dependent. A possible reason is that Plantago and wheat straw addition stimulated soil aggregation to a greater degree, resulting in more newly formed aggregates containing microplastic, the incorporated microplastic fibers led to less stable aggregates, and decrease in enzyme activities. This highlights an important aspect of the context dependency of microplastic effects in soil and on soil health. Our results also suggest risks for soil stability associated with organic matter additions, such as is common in agroecosystems, when microplastics are present.},

This study investigated the occurrence of MPs and PAEs in Shouguang (SG) and Xuzhou (XZ), two typical facility agriculture areas in China with years of history of vegetable greenhouse plantation. Thirty-four soil samples covering greenhouse and non-greenhouse soils were collected. MPs were quantified using the laser direct infrared (LDIR) method to realize IR analysis for all the collected particles. The total MP and PAE was 380–3786 pieces/kg and 0.30–1.58~mg/kg, respectively. The MP content in greenhouse soil was significantly higher than that in non-greenhouse soil in both areas. However, this trend for PAEs was only found in XZ, but not in SG. A positive correlation was observed between MPs and PAEs in XZ but not in SG. Our results suggested that MP concentrations mainly depend on input, while the residue of PAEs in soil was a consequence of both input and removal. Even in the facility soil, MPs and PAEs may not always possess a definitive relationship, and other environmental factors must be considered to elucidate the relationship between them.},

A field study was conducted to compare soil CO2 concentrations and soil surface CO2 fluxes between TC and MC systems during a cotton growing season. CO2 concentrations in the soil profile were higher in the MC system (3107-9212 μL L−1) than in the TC system (1275-8994 μL L−1) but the rate of CO2 flux was lower in the MC system. Possible reasons for this included decreased gas diffusion and higher soil moisture due to the mulching cover in the MC system, and the consumption of soil CO2 by weathering reactions. Over the whole cotton growing season, accumulated rates of CO2 flux were 300 and 394 g C m−2 for the MC and TC systems, respectively. When agricultural practices were converted from traditional cultivation to a plastic film mulching system, soil CO2 emissions could be reduced by approximately 100 g C m−2 year−1 in agricultural lands in arid and/or semi-arid areas of northern and northwestern China.},

The field was planted with spring wheat and mulched with plastic film for various lengths of time. Our primary objectives were to (i) explore the influence of film mulching on soil MBC and soil fertility, and (ii) seek an effective approach of maintaining and improving sustainability of cropland mulched with plastic film in two growing seasons. Four treatments were tested, non-mulching (M0), mulching for 30 days after sowing (M30), mulching for 60 DAS (M60) and mulching for the whole growing period (Mw). An increasing air temperature with time within the growing season promoted soil MBC in the two growing seasons, but a severe drought led to a lower MBC in 2000 compared with the wet year of 1999. Film mulching promoted MBC significantly in the 2 years, but decreased soil organic carbon (SOC). SOC is very low in the experimental soil, accounting for the higher MBC/SOC ratio compared with ratios reported by others. The SOC is greatly reduced in the non-mulched and the Mw treatments compared to the M30 and M60 treatments. In conclusion, the benefits of film mulching in semi-arid agricultural systems are enormous but realizing their full potential depends on how long the mulching material is maintained during the growing season. In the system tested, it is desirable to mulch the plots for 30–60 DAS in order to enhance microbial biomass and cycling of nutrients and also to provide a more stable soil micro-environment that generates more residues in the rhizosphere.},

Mulching increased temperature and moisture in the upper 5 cm of soil, and shoots emerged 8 d earlier than in CK. Mulching also increased number of tillers, length of the growing period, spikelet and grain numbers per spike, and the duration from flowering to harvest. In the mulched treatments, photosynthesis rate and soluble sugar content were higher in the vegetative period, but soluble sugar content was lower in the grain filling period relative to CK. Grain yield following 20 d mulching was greatest (8207 kg ha−1), and decreased gradually as the mulching period increased (7847 and 6702 kg ha−1 for M2 and M3, respectively). Plastic film removed after 20 d maximizes yield and minimizes soil pollution.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the effects of a modern cultivation system of plastic film mulching with drip irrigation (MD) on soil greenhouse gas fluxes, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were quantified and contrasted in an MD system and a traditional system of mulch-free flood-irrigated (MFF) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in fields of northwest China. The results showed that soil N2O flux and the absorption rate of CH4 were lower in the MD than the MFF sites. A possible reason for the higher CH4 emissions at MD sites was that the relatively low gaseous oxygen (O2) availability and high ammonium (NH4 +) content in the MD soil increased CH4 generation by methanogens and decreased CH4 oxidation by methanotrophs. The lower N2O in the MD sites may be due to an increase of soil denitrification by Thiobacillus denitrificans that reduced some nitrous compounds further into nitrogen gas (N2). Taking into account the global warming potentials of CH4 and N2O in a 100-year time horizon, during the entire growth period, the contribution of CH4 to the greenhouse effect was significantly lower than N2O in these two treatments. Considering these two greenhouse gas fluxes together, a transition from non-mulching cultivation to mulching cultivation could reduce atmospheric emissions by c. 20 g CO2 e m2/season. Based on these findings and previous studies, it can be concluded that mulched-drip irrigation cultivation is a good way to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases and reduce the global warming impact of arid farmlands.},

  abstract = {Biodegradable plastic films are desirable alternatives to traditional black polyethylene plastic for use as mulches in agroecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to engineer biodegradable plastic mulches that could be incorporated into the soil at the end of the crop season, and decomposed by microorganisms, ultimately to CO2, H2O, and biomass. Whether changes in soil quality occur during or following biodegradation is unknown. An 18-month study evaluated the effects on soil quality following burial of four potentially biodegradable mulches and a no mulch control in high tunnel and open field tomato production systems across three geographically distinct locations (Knoxville, TN; Lubbock, TX; Mount Vernon, WA). The mulch treatments included: two starch-based mulches (BioAgri® Ag-Film and BioTelo Agri); one experimental 100\% polylactic acid mulch (Spunbond-PLA-10); one cellulose-based mulch (WeedGuardPlus; positive control); and a negative control (no mulch). The soil management assessment framework (SMAF) was used to calculate a soil quality index (SQI) according to five dynamic soil properties: microbial biomass carbon, β-glucosidase, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC), and pH. Within the 18-month evaluation period, the effects of the biodegradable mulches on the SQI were minor, and dependent upon production system and time of incubation at all locations. In general, the SQI was higher in the high tunnel systems for some of the mulch treatments at Knoxville and Lubbock but the opposite was true at Mount Vernon. By the final sampling at 18 months, the SQI was lowest for WeedGuardPlus at Lubbock and Mount Vernon but at Knoxville, the WeedGuardPlus SQI was not significantly different from the no mulch control. Of the five SMAF indicators evaluated, soil microbial biomass and β-glucosidase activity were the most responsive to mulch and production systems, supporting the use of these variables as soil quality indicators for short-term changes due to this agricultural management practice.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are emerging contaminants and widely distributed in the environment. They are considered as a vector of numerous organic pollutants including antibiotics in aquatic environments and thereby influence their distribution and transport behaviors. However, the effects of microplastics on the environmental behavior of antibiotics in soils remain largely unclear. In this paper, the influence of polyamide (PA) microplastics on sorption and transport of the selected antibiotic [oxytetracycline (OTC)] in a sandy loamy soil was studied by performing batch and column experiments. Results show that PA microplastics increase the pH of reaction systems, which contributes to OTC sorption onto the tested soils. However, altering pH is not the key influencing mechanism because the overall sorption capacity decreases slightly after adding PA microplastics, which can be attributed to the dilution effect. Reduction of OTC sorption by adding microplastics promotes the migration of OTC in the tested soil, which could be demonstrated by the results of column experiments that the breakthrough of OTC occurs earlier with an increasing content of PA microplastics. According to the fitting parameters of HYDRUS−1D model, PA microplastics can affect the transport of OTC by altering the soil pore structure and dispersion coefficient. These results provide new insight into the interaction between microplastics and organic pollutants in soil environments.},

The bioavailability of the metals determined by the five-step chemical sequential extraction method increased with the addition of MPs (0.1\%, 1\%, 10\%) in the soil, which was confirmed by the adsorption-desorption characteristics. To further examine the bioavailability and toxicity of metals, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to soil containing Cu2+ (100~mg/kg) or Ni2+ (40~mg/kg) with different amounts (0.01\%, 0.05\%, and 0.1\%) of PE-MPs for 21~days. The highest concentrations of Cu2+ and Ni2+ in earthworms reached to 73.3 and 36.3~mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, metal concentrations in earthworms increased with MP contents in the soil, which was consistent with the bioavailability measured by the sequential extraction method. Furthermore, changes in biomarkers including peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and related gene expression levels in earthworms suggested that the pollutants caused toxicity to earthworms. Overall, MPs increased the bioavailability of metals in the soil and the toxic effects to earthworms. These findings provide insights regarding the impacts of MPs on the bioavailability of metals and the combined toxic effects of these two kinds of pollutants on terrestrial animals.},

The experiment started in 2001 at five sites and ended in 2003 with one rice crop annually. Three treatments included plastic film mulching with no flooding (PM), no plastic film mulching and no flooding (UM), and traditional flooding management (TF). Soil samples were collected after the third year of the experimentation and were analyzed for soil properties. PM increased soil temperature, accelerated decomposition of organic carbon and root growth, there was a slight but statistically insignificant trend of decline in soil bulk density. PM produced the similar rice grain yield as TF at two sites, significantly higher grain yield (5.8\% and 20.0\% higher) at other two sites, but significantly lower (34.3\% lower) yield at one site where no irrigation water was applied and rainfall was the sole water source for rice growth. PM increased water use efficiency by 69.6–106.0\% and irrigation water use efficiency by 273.7–519.6\%. Compared to TF, PM decreased soil organic matter content by 8.3–24.5\%, soil total N by 5.2–22.0\%, and available K by 9.6–50.4\% at all sites. PM treatment also reduced soil available N by 8.5–26.5\% at four sites. Soil total P content in PM treatments reduced by 13.5–27.8\% at three sites, and increased by 6.6–8.2\% at other two sites. However, PM increased soil available P by 20.9–64.7\% at all sites. Systematic cluster analysis indicated the PM treatment distinctively clustered from the other treatment. These results suggested PM could gain higher yield under appropriate water condition and PM may change soil nutrient cycle.},

  abstract = {The continuous increase in synthetic plastic production and poor management in plastic waste have led to a tremendous increase in the dumping into our aqueous environment. Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5 mm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters. Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles. In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330 μm for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk.},

However, comparison of reported microplastic abundances and other pollution characteristics are often impossible or require additional calculations based on assumptions. 5.Environmental effect of MPs in agricultural soils. Yet, the current data based on microplastic pollution in soil is still poor. Accordingly, further research on the prevalence and fate of MPs in agricultural soils is urgently warranted. In addition, we also suggest other perspectives for future studies on microplastic pollution and soil ecotoxicity of plastic wastes, providing a direction for such research.},

  abstract = {Plastic film mulching has been extensively used in farmland, especially in arid regions, for over half-century. However, this has led to heavy pollution of soils by microplastics (MPs). Currently, efficient extraction of MPs from the organo-mineral soil matrix is a problem because microsize clay particles tightly adhere to MPs. It is therefore extremely challenging to investigate, identify, quantify, and characterize MP particles and their behavior in agricultural soils. In this study, we developed a simple and effective method of separating and extracting MPs from the soil matrix. Clean polyethylene (PE) MPs were obtained after a series of treatments including pressure leaching, flotation, electrostatic adsorption, and concentrated sulfuric acid (98\% H2SO4) carbonization. The characteristics of MP pollutants, such as abundance, size, and morphology, in soils that have been continuously mulched with PE film for various periods of time were determined after extraction. The highest abundance of MPs (40.35~mg/kg) with sizes ranging from 0.9–2.0~mm was found in soil samples that had been continuously mulched with plastic film for 30~years. The sampled MP particles are in the microplastic size (0.8–0.3~mm) range, and the size of MPs decreases gradually as the period of mulching increased. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the surface of the MP particles showed visible cracks, with round holes, and the particle surface roughened as the number of years of continuous mulching increased. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that the absorption peak area of hydrocarbyl (–CH2) of PE MPs decreased significantly, and the typical oxidation characteristic peak area increased as the mulching period increased. The concentration of mesoplastics also increased, from 91.20~mg/kg to 308.50~mg/kg, when the mulching period increased from 5 to 30~years.},

  abstract = {Plastic film mulch technology is a cropping system feature for water saving that is used extensively in arid and semiarid areas of northwest China. When evaporative demand is fairly strong, film mulching can greatly reduce soil water evaporation. However, research on water flow beneath and through various open hole ratios of the perforated film mulches is limited, and questions concerning soil water flow and soil heat transfer for this type of water-saving system remain unanswered. It is, therefore, very important to perform research on soil water evaporation and soil temperature distribution with various open hole ratios of the perforated plastic mulches. A series of soil water evaporation experiments using different open hole ratios of perforated plastic mulches was conducted. The columns received mulches with various open hole ratios: 0\% (covered with a solid plastic mulch), 1.39\%, 2.84\%, 7.24\%, 30.5\%, and 100\% (nonmulched bare surface). In conjunction with the water movement of evaporation from film hole studies, soil temperature distributions were also analyzed. Our measurements indicated that film hole mulch had a restraining effect on evaporation and that the restraining effect decreased with the increase in open hole ratios. Compared with bare soil evaporation, the percentage of evaporation reduction rates for open hole ratios of 0\%, 1.39\%, 2.84\%, 7.24\%, and 30.5\% were 69.26\%, 33.09\%, 22.80\%, 20.05\%, and 11.82\%, respectively. The results showed a linear relationship between cumulative water evaporation and square root of time for the different open hole ratios of the perforated plastic mulches, and the coefficients of the linear function, i.e., the C parameters, were fitted well with the open hole ratiosâ€”u(C = 0.0101 u0.1019 + 0.0075). On this basis, mathematical relations of relative evaporation rate and evaporation based on hole areas of perforated plastic mulches were analyzed and discussed. These results extend the Gardner evaporation equation to bare soils to include water evaporation from soils covered by various perforated plastic mulches. The resulting equations presented in this paper provide an approach for describing evaporation from plastic mulch-covered soil. THE annual evaporative demand of arid and semiarid regions near Xinjiang in northwest China exceeds 2000 mm whereas annual precipitation is less than 200 mm (Yearbook of water conservation for Xinjiang, China, 2001). Thus, a great need exists in the area to make efficient use of all agricultural water. Plastic mulch cultivation, a management technique used in recent years, has been applied extensively in arid and semiarid regions in China. The use of plastic mulch cultivation to reduce soil water evaporation and increase early spring soil temperature has demonstrated great potential in arid and semiarid regions. At the same time, irrigation methods corresponding to the plastic mulch practices have also been developed. These methods include plastic mulch irrigation through open holes in the perforated plastic films, trickle irrigation under the plastic films, and lateral film irrigation. According to the 2001 statistical data of Xinjiang, the plastic mulch cultivation area has been extended to 1.4 million ha, of which, the total plastic mulch irrigation area is 670,000 ha (Yearbook of water conservation for Xinjiang, China, 2001). To support plant emergence and irrigation water distribution, the plastic mulch must be perforated. A critical parameter for effective use of perforated plastic mulches is the open hole ratio of each plastic mulch, i.e., the area of opened holes over the total area of the plastic mulch. Topics that require further research are the measurement and the estimation of perforated plastic mulch open hole ratios on soil water evaporation. Plastic mulches can also increase soil temperature, and the increase in soil temperature can cause changes in soil water distribution (Hua and Wang, 1993). Thus the coupled transport of water and heat in soils should be researched in order to understand the fundamental features of soil water evaporation with different open hole ratios of plastic mulch. Research regarding bare soil water evaporation has been conducted by experimental methods, theoretical analysis, and numerical calculation (Bachmann et al., 2001;Black et al., 1969;Brisson and Perrier, 1991;Fritton et al., 1970;Gardner, 1959;Gardner and Gardner, 1969;Reynolds and Walker, 1984;Lascano and van Bavel, 1986;Milly, 1984;Munley and Hipps, 1991;Philip, 1957;Suleiman and Ritchie, 2003). The evaporation equation for bare soils developed by Gardner (1959) is one of the most popular equations for calculation of soil water evaporation. Gardner (1959) solved the Richards equation based on an exponential relationship between soil water diffusivity and soil water content. He found that cumulative evaporation was a linear function of the square root of time. The relationship can be expressed as follows (Black et al., 1969;Gardner, 1959;Reynolds and Walker, 1984):EQUATION Where E is cumulative water evaporation from the soil surface, cm; C is a coefficient related to characteristics of soil; and t is time in minutes. Water evaporation from mulched soil has been reported in some papers. Chung and Horton (1987) developed a numerical model using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) finite difference method to study two-dimensional coupled soil heat and water flow with partial surface mulching. Mahrer et al. (1984) studied onedimensional heat and water flow when a transparent polyethylene mulch covered the entire soil surface. However, the influence of open hole ratios of perforated mulches on soil water evaporation has not been evaluated. The objective of this research was to perform a series of soil water evaporation experiments using different open hole ratios of perforated plastic mulches. The influence of open hole ratios of plastic mulch on soil temperature, soil water content distribution, and cumulative evaporation were analyzed, and an equation extending the Gardner evaporation equation was developed.},

In this study, two kinds of PVC microplastics with different particle sizes (PVC-a with particle sizes from 100~nm to 18~μm, and PVC-b with particle sizes from 18 to 150~μm) and different content levels (0.5\%, 1\%, and 2\%) were used to analyze the effects of PVC microplastics on the physiological characteristics of the lettuce root system and leaves. The results showed that PVC-a and PVC-b had no significant effect on the lettuce root activity. However, 0.5\%a and 1\%a significantly increased the total length, surface area, volume, and diameter of roots. In terms of leaves, PVC-a and PVC-b had no significant effect on the malondialdehyde content, but 1\%a significantly increased the superoxide dismutase activity. Carotenoid synthesis was promoted by PVC-a but inhibited by PVC-b. Furthermore, 1\%a could reduce the ability of light energy absorption, dissipation, capture, and electron transfer. The gray correlation analysis indicated that PVC-a correlated to a considerable degree with the indices related to photosynthesis, while PVC-b was significantly correlated with the indices related to root morphology. This study provides insights into the ecotoxicological effect of microplastics on farmland crops and associated ecological risk assessment.},

We conducted field experiments using spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Longchun 8139-2) to examine the effect of film-mulching with varying durations on crop yield and soil properties in 1999 and 2000 on Loess Orthic Entisols in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. The three mulching treatments with varying durations were applied: (1) M30: mulching for 30 days after sowing (DAS); (2) M60: mulching for 60 DAS; (3) Mw: mulching for the whole growth period, as well as the control; M0: without mulching. In 1999, seedlings from the three mulching treatments emerged 8 days earlier than those from unmulchingly treated. In 2000, a very dry year, emergence of seedlings in the mulching treatments occurred only 1–2 days earlier compared to control. Moreover, mulching treatments also significantly increased the total root biomass before 90 DAS in 1999 and before 30 DAS in 2000. There was a sharp increase in soil respiration in the mulching treatments. Soil microbial biomass nitrogen content in the Mw treatment was significantly lower at 43 DAS than that in control. Accumulation of total mineral nitrogen in the soil at harvest was clearly higher in Mw than in the other treatments and the control. Highest yields were recorded from wheat treated with M60 (3305 and 1203 kg ha−1 in 1999 and 2000, respectively). By contrast, no significant difference in yield was found among the three-mulched treatments in 1999. In 1999 the water use efficiency in all mulching treatments was significantly higher than in control, while in 2000 it was significantly higher in M60 and Mw than in M30 and control. These findings therefore suggest that mulching for 60 DAS increased grain yield by increasing the mineral nitrogen, soil water and the efficiency of water use and avoiding the over-decomposition of organic matter and over-mineralization of organic nitrogen.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are an emerging and persistent form of environmental contaminants, and they have been detected in a variety of environments. Most researchers have focused on microplastics in marine environments, but there are relatively fewer studies on farmland soil ecosystems. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate feasible and effective methods for the identification and quantification of microplastics in farmland soil using pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC-MS). In this work, we report on the application of density flotation, filter membranes, and digestion for effective separation and preconcentration of microplastics in soil samples. Subsequently, we optimised the density separation approach according to the number of flotations and the density of the flotation solution. The results showed that flotation twice with NaCl solution and once with ZnCl2 solution achieved a high recovery rate of microplastics at the lowest cost. A recovery percentage of 77.30–94.87\% was achieved. The precision of the recovery expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the peak area was 5.05\% for polyethylene (PE) microplastics, 1.71\% for polypropylene (PP) microplastics, and 0.78\% for polystyrene (PS) microplastics. The above data indicated that the proposed method showed excellent reproducibility and high sensitivity. Among the samples, the main component was PE (60\%), followed by PP (20\%) and PS (20\%). The average concentrations of PE, PP, and PS microplastics in the soil were 685.55, 1069.98, and 864.23 μg/g, respectively. Based on these results, we conclude that our method has the potential for application in routine analyses.},

  abstract = {Background: Mycotoxins are big concerns in food safety. Analytical methods are important for the evaluation of mycotoxins in different food commodities. Objective: In this study, stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) was compared with a matrix-matched calibration method for the quantification of mycotoxins in four different commercially available commodities and two reference materials. Methods: All samples were extracted with water–acetonitrile (50+50, v/v), followed by filtration and LC–tandem MS analysis. Results: SIDA calibration accuracies ranged from 78.6 to 112\% with relative SDs (RSDs) ≤16\% across all four matrices. The majority of the recoveries across all matrices ranged from 70 to 120\% with RSDs {$<$}11\%. Of the four mycotoxins in the reference materials analyzed, only three had 13C-internal standard (IS), whereas the fourth was quantified using a closely eluting 13C-IS for a different mycotoxin. Mycotoxins paired with their corresponding 13C-IS had accuracies {$>$}90\%, whereas accuracies for the mismatched mycotoxin/13C-IS were {$<$}14\%. Conclusions: When 13C-IS are not available, matrix-matched calibration was also evaluated as an alternative to quantitating target mycotoxins. The use of 13C-IS is the best way to dynamically account for prevalent matrix effects, but matrix matching provides a viable alternative. Highlights: The study compared SIDA and matrix-matched calibration methods in terms of recovery, efficiency, advantages, and limitations for LC-MS based mycotoxin analysis.},

In the present study, an online thermogravimetry (TG)–Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR)–mass spectrometry (MS) technology was used to investigate the effect of anaerobic digestion (AD) on gaseous products from sewage sludge pyrolysis. Compared with the raw sludge, the anaerobically digested sludge had similar derivative TG (DTG) profiles and evolved gaseous composition, but its weight loss and releasing amount of most of gaseous compounds during the pyrolysis was lower. AD caused a decrease in the emission of N-containing and Cl-containing gaseous groups by 22.4–87.6\%, but an increase in one possible S-containing group by 20.1\%. The generation of more-than-186-m/z gaseous components showed a low reduction and even a slight increase after AD, possibly ascribed to thermal decomposition of some large refractory polysaccharide–like and aromatic substances. Some gaseous compounds such as CH4, CH3COOH, and CH3CHO obtained from the sludge pyrolysis reduced significantly after AD, which might enable to conveniently and quickly evaluate sludge anaerobic biodegradability. The findings imply that the TG-FTIR-MS supplies new insights about the influence of AD on sludge pyrolysis on the account of gaseous products.},

Significant differences were observed in lag periods and biotransformation rates among the phthalic acid isomers and under the different atmospheres. In most cases, the relative biotransformation rates of the three isomers of phthalic acid were ortho-phthalic acid \&gt; isophthalic acid \&gt; terephthalic acid. Benzoate was transformed faster than any isomer of phthalic acid. Since biotransformation of phthalic acid isomers in sediment slurries was enhanced by high initial levels of H2 and CO2 in the headspace, we propose a pathway for phthalic acid biodegradation in which the initial transformation to benzoate is CO2–H2 dependent. Acetogenic bacteria were investigated for their possible involvement in this transformation reaction, but when MPN counts were used to compare the growth dynamics of acetogenic bacteria with the time course of the terephthalic acid transformation under N2/H2 (19:1, v/v) and CO2/H2 (4:1, v/v) atmospheres, the results were inconclusive.},

The study was conducted in a typical semiarid area during two growing seasons of 2006–2007 with the following three treatments: (i) plastic film mulching at maize sowing with conventional tillage, and the film was removed at harvest (CK); (ii) mulching applied 30 d before sowing with conventional tillage, and the film was removed at harvest (T1); and (iii) mulching at sowing with no-tillage, and the film left on the field after harvest in the first season and used for mulching in the second season (T2). The T1 in both years and T2 in the second year (2007) improved soil water content (in the 0–60 cm layer) and temperature (10 cm) at sowing compared with CK. After the two seasons, the soil water content was significantly higher in the 0–80 cm soil layer in CK and T1, and in the 0–120 cm soil layer in T2; however, it decreased significantly in 140–200 cm soil layer in CK and T1, compared to their initial values at sowing in April 2006, and there was no significant change in T2. The rainfall storage in the 0–200 cm soil layer during the non-growing season (late September 2006 to late April 2007) was 18.2 mm in CK, 34.0 mm in T1, and 59.7 mm in T2, and the rainfall storage in 100–200 cm soil layer was 16.5 and 18.6 mm higher in T2 than in CK and T1, respectively. In 2006, there were no significant differences in yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in all treatments. In 2007, the yield in T1 was significantly higher than in T2, but yields in T2 and CK were not significantly different, and there was no significant difference in WUE among treatments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) (0–20 cm) decreased in CK and T1, but increased (by 2.7\%) in T2 at harvesting in September 2007 from the initial value of sowing in April 2006. The ratio of output to input was 1.32:1 for CK, 1.40:1 for T1, and 1.67:1 for T2 averaged across the two seasons. Therefore, T2 was a more sustainable model for increasing water storage, producing greater economic benefit and maintaining SOC balance for maize production in semiarid area.},

In this study, we explored the sustainability of this agroecosystem with different mulching time during two growing seasons over 2006 and 2007. Three treatments were designed: (i) plastic film mulching applied at sowing and film removed at harvest (CK); (ii) mulching applied 30 days before sowing and removed at harvest (M1); and (iii) mulching applied at sowing and film left on field after harvest and used continually for mulching in the second season (M2). Microbial biomass C (MBC) and ratio of MBC to soil organic C (SOC) (MBC/SOC) were higher in M1 and M2 than in CK in 2007 growing season. The reduction rates of the ratios of light fraction of organic C (LFOC) to SOC (LFOC/SOC) with sampling dates were 0.0020, 0.0047 and 0.0045 for CK, M1 and M2, respectively. A larger value means a faster reduction rate of LFOC/SOC with sampling dates, and implying farming system would face a higher unsustainable risk. MBC correlated negative significantly with LFOC (R~=~−0.939, P~=~0.0001) and mineral N (R~=~−0.835, P~=~0.0007) due to low soil C pool. Accordingly, film mulched ridge and furrow system would threaten the sustainability of soil ecosystem via MBC increase a semi-arid agroecosystem. The practices of mulching applied 30 d before sowing (M1) and use of plastic film once every two years (M2) lead to increased environmental risk for the farming system.},

The effects of long-term mulching on the soil-microbe-plant system, however, are largely unknown. As mulching years is positively correlated with PMFR concentrations, we used a controlled pot experiment to investigate the effects of mulching years (20a: The concentration of PMFR is about 2~g~kg−1, 60a: About 6~g~kg−1) on rice growth, rhizosphere bacterial communities, and soil organic carbon (SOC) under different soil pH conditions. Mulching years reduced rice growth; 20a showed more negative effects than 60a on rice tillers number and biomass. PMFR changed the composition, diversity, and metabolic function of the rhizosphere bacterial communities. The content of SOC decreased as mulching residues increased; total organic carbon (TOC), soil organic matter (SOM), Fn (355), and humification index (HIX) declined by 30.24\%, 55.97\%, 59.74\%, and 70.24\%, respectively. Furthermore, significant correlations between bacterial communities and SOC were observed in the soil-microbe-plant system. PMFR showed stronger negative effects on rice growth in acidic soil (pH 4.5); however, in basic soil (pH 8.5), there were stronger variations within the bacterial communities and a more significant decline in SOC than acidic soil (pH 4.5). The results of this study are expected to provide theoretical references for understanding of the effects of PMFR on agroecosystems and preventing and controlling plastic pollution.},

  abstract = {Water-saving ground cover rice production systems (GCRPS) can increase grain yield in mountainous regions with seasonal water shortages and cold, stress-inducing temperatures. For GCRPS the soil surface is covered with a plastic film which can effectively alleviate low-temperature stress in the early growth stage due to thermal insulation. Since topdressing is not possible in GCRPS, farmers usually apply all fertilizer as basal dressing before transplanting; this can lead to excessive growth during the vegetative period and low crop growth during the reproductive stage. However, we hypothesized that the technique might be well suited for marginal rice growing regions in the Northeast of China. These areas are characterized by a short vegetation period and soils rich in organic matter, delivering the required amounts of nitrogen (N) over the course of the season due to N mineralization. Here we report on a two year experiment, conducted in the Northeast of China, that compared grain yields between GCRPS and conventional paddy rice production (paddy) at three N fertilizer rates (0, 90 and 135 kg N ha−1). Furthermore, crop growth rate, apparent nitrogen recovery rate and nitrogen physiological use efficiency were calculated. Compared to paddy, GCRPS significantly increased grain yield by 31\%, 14\% and 10\% at N fertilizer rate of 0, 90 and 135 kg N ha−1, respectively. Grain yield at 135 kg N ha−1 was significantly higher than 90 kg N ha−1 in paddy, but no difference was found between N fertilizer rates in GCRPS. However, grain yield at 90 kg N ha−1 in GCRPS was still higher than that at 135 kg N ha−1 in paddy. The considerably higher number of filled grains in GCRPS indicates that crop growth rate during the reproductive stage was improved, likely due to the positive effect of higher mineralization of organic N on crops with a low rate of N fertilization. Our study demonstrates that GCRPS is a very promising and highly suitable technique for rice production in cold regions in the North of China that possess high content of soil organic matter. Moreover, it shows that N fertilization can be minimized due to the autochthonous N supply from soil rich in organic matter. In regards to the decomposition of SOM in GCRPS over time, mutual feedback mechanisms located both above and below ground revealed that the potential loss of SOM stocks can be compensated by a greater input of root biomass in GCRPS.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MP) have been recently found in soil environments. These MP might have adverse effects at high concentrations and thus efficient extraction and analysis of MP from soil is needed. Here we propose a new method of NaBr solution circulation for extracting soil MP. A device for the circular extraction of soil MP was developed. This device included a separation, vacuum filtration, and solution recovery system. It was then utilized to test separation efficiency of soil MP with three economic and environmentally friendly extraction reagents: NaCl, CaCl2 and NaBr solutions. The separation was tested with ten different types of polymers, three different size classes and three different shapes of MP. Extraction with NaBr showed the highest recovery rates ranging from 85\% to 100\%. After extraction the samples were treated with H2O2 and analyzed by micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The developed method was assessed for its potential influence on MP and no significant changes in the integrity of multiple MP were found. Finally, the established method was used to analyze MP in four types of soil: farmland, yellow-brown, paddy and floodplain soil from the suburb of Shanghai. Results showed that the mean abundance of MP was 136.6–256.7 item kg−1. Various MP including PP (40\%), PE (35.5\%), Acrylic (15.6\%), PET (6.7\%) and PA (2.2\%) were found.

In this study, we investigated microplastics and mesoplastics in farmland soils from twenty vegetable fields around the suburbs of Shanghai. In each site, three duplicate soil samples were collected from shallow (0–3 cm) and deep soils (3–6 cm), respectively. Microplastics (sizes of 20 μm - 5 mm) and mesoplastics (5 mm - 2 cm) were detected using methods of density extraction, 30\% H2O2 digestion and micro-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The abundance of microplastics was 78.00 ± 12.91 and 62.50 ± 12.97 items kg−1 in shallow and deep soils, respectively. While, mesoplastics were found with abundance of 6.75 ± 1.51 and 3.25 ± 1.04 items kg−1 in shallow and deep soils. Among these micro(meso)plastics, 48.79\% and 59.81\% were in size of {$<$}1 mm in shallow and deep soils. The main morphotypes of microplastics included fiber, fragment and film, mostly in color of black or transparent. Moreover, we found that topsoil contained higher concentrations and larger sizes of micro(meso)plastics than deep soil. In addition, the vast majority of micro(meso)plastics were polypropylene (50.51\%) and polyethylene (43.43\%).

  abstract = {In the environment, microplastics are subjected to multiple aging processes; however, information regarding the impact of aging on the environmental behavior of microplastics is still lacking. This study investigated the alteration properties of polystyrene and high-density polyethylene microplastics by heat-activated K2S2O8 and Fenton treatments to improve the understanding of their long-term natural aging in aquatic environments. Our results indicated that the O/C ratio was an alternative parameter to the carbonyl index (CI) to quantitatively describe the surface alteration properties of microplastics. The correlation model of the O/C ratio or CI versus alteration time was developed and compared by natural alteration of microplastics in freshwater samples. Moreover, the regression equation of the equilibrium adsorption capacity of altered microplastics versus the O/C ratio and average size was proposed. This study is the first effort in differentiating the relationships between the alteration properties and alteration time/adsorption capacity of microplastics, which would be helpful for predicting the weathering degree and accumulation of hydrophilic antibiotics onto aged microplastics in aquatic environments. This research develops promising strategies to accelerate the aging reactions using advanced oxidation processes, which would provide further information to assess the microplastic pollution in actual environments.},

  abstract = {Nanoplastics (NPs) are becoming an emerging pollutant of global concern. A potential risk is that NPs may serve as carriers to increase the spreading of coexisting contaminants. In this study, we examined the effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs, 100 nm), used as a model NP, on the transport of five organic contaminants of different polarity in saturated soil. The presence of low concentrations of PSNPs significantly enhanced the transport of nonpolar (pyrene) and weakly polar (2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether) compounds, but had essentially no effects on the transport of three polar compounds (bisphenol A, bisphenol F, and 4-nonylphenol). The strikingly different effects of NPs on the transport of nonpolar/weakly polar versus polar contaminants could not be explained with different adsorption affinities, but was consistent with the polarity-dependent extents of desorption hysteresis. Notably, desorption hysteresis was only observed for nonpolar/weakly polar contaminants, likely because nonpolar compounds tended to adsorb in the inner matrices of glassy polymeric structure of polystyrene (resulting in physical entrapment of adsorbates), whereas polar compounds favored surface adsorption. This hypothesis was verified with supplemental adsorption and desorption experiments of pyrene and 4-nonylphenol using a dense, glassy polystyrene polymer and a flexible, rubbery polyethylene polymer. Overall, the findings of this study underscore the potentially significant environmental implication of NPs as contaminant carriers.},

However, how beneficial soil microbes, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in particular, respond to the PFM practice is not known. Here, a field experiment was performed to study the effects of a 3-month short-term PFM practice on AM fungi in plots planted with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Dingxi-2) in the Loess Plateau. AM colonization, spore density, wheat spike weight, and grain phosphorus (P) content were significantly increased in the PFM treatments, and these changes were mainly attributable to changes in soil properties such as available P and soil moisture. Alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher in PFM soils, but levels of AM fungal-related glomalin were similar between treatments. A total of nine AM fungal phylotypes were detected in root samples based on AM fungal SSU rDNA analyses, with six and five phylotypes in PFM and no-PFM plots, respectively. Although AM fungal phylotype richness was not statistically different between treatments, the community compositions were different, with four and three specific phylotypes in the PFM and no-PFM plots, respectively. A significant and rapid change in AM fungal, wheat, and soil variables following PFM suggested that the functioning of the AM symbiosis had been changed in the wheat field under PFM. Future studies are needed to investigate whether PFM applied over a longer term has a similar effect on the AM fungal community and their functioning in an agricultural ecosystem.},

Understanding mulching effects on nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) and soil nitrogen dynamics is important for optimizing N management strategies. A 3-year field experiment was performed on the Loess Plateau of China to investigate the GM and FM effects on plant N accumulation, N translocation, N harvest index (NHI), NUE and soil NO3 −-N dynamics in dryland maize fields. Compared with the control (CK, non-mulching), the mulching treatments markedly promoted plant N accumulation and especially maintained higher N uptake rates during the post-silking stage. At harvest, the total N accumulation was 12.8–41.2 and 33.2–55.8 \% higher in the GM and FM treatments, respectively, than in the CK treatment. The NHIs of the mulching treatments were significantly higher by 9.6–32.4 \% than the CK treatment, primarily due to greater N translocation and N accumulation post-silking. Overall, compared with the CK treatment, the GM and FM NUEs increased significantly by 17.1 and 28.3 \% in 2010, 70.3 and 87.6 \% in 2011, and 16.7 and 38.2 \% in 2012, respectively. In the wet years of 2010 and 2011, the increased amount of soil NO3 −-N in the 100–200 cm layer after harvest was 27.1–57.1 and 47.9–85.7 \% lower in the GM and FM treatments, respectively, than in the CK treatment, indicating a lower NO3 −-N leaching loss. These results suggest that mulching (especially FM) is an effective measure for increasing NUE and grain yield and decreasing N leaching loss in dry farmland.},

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a central role in driving soil biogeochemistry, but little information is available on the effects of plastic residues, especially microplastic, on soil DOM. We conducted a soil-incubation experiment in a climate-controlled chamber with three levels of microplastic added to loess soil collected from the Loess Plateau in China: 0\% (control, CK), 7\% (M1) and 28\% (M2) (w/w). We analysed the soil contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, NO3−, dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), and PO43− and the activities of fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse) and phenol oxidase. The higher level of microplastic addition significantly increased the nutrient contents of the DOM solution. The lower level of addition had no significant effect on the DOM solution during the first seven days, but the rate of DOM decomposition decreased in M1 between days 7 and 30, which increased the nutrient contents. The microplastic facilitated the accumulation of high-molecular-weight humic-like material between days 7 and 30. The DOM solutions were mainly comprised of high-molecular-weight humic-like material in CK and M1 and of high-molecular-weight humic-like material and tyrosine-like material in M2. The Microplastic stimulated the activities of both enzymes. Microplastic addition thus stimulated enzymatic activity, activated pools of organic C, N, and P, and was beneficial for the accumulation of dissolved organic C, N and P.},

The area of plastic film coverage in China reached approximately 20 million hectares, and the amount of plastic film used reached 1.25 million tons in 2011. While producing huge benefits, plastic film mulch technology has also brought on a series of pollution hazards. Large amounts of residual plastic film have detrimental effects on soil structure, water and nutrient transport and crop growth, thereby disrupting the agricultural environment and reducing crop production. To control pollution, the Chinese government urgently needs to elevate plastic film standards.

In this study, the vertical migration of microplastics along soil profile under three crop roots (corn, soybean, and ryegrass) was analyzed by a laboratory-scale incubation experiment. When microplastics were initially distributed in the surface layer, crop roots showed little effects on the vertical migration of microplastics. But in terms of homogenous microplastic distribution along soil profile, corn roots could contribute to the upward movement of microplastics in the middle layers (7–12~cm). It could be related to more pores and fissures created by primary and secondary corn roots and buoyancy effects once the pores and fissures were filled with water. Additionally, a significant positive correlation between microplastic numbers and tertiary roots of ryegrass has been observed and indicated the microplastic retention ability of fine crop roots. According to the results, in contrast to the downward microplastic migration caused by water infiltration and soil fauna activities, crop roots tended to move microplastics upwards or maintain them in soil layers.},

Since concentrations of MPs in the environment are usually low, the large sample volumes required for these techniques lead to an excess of coenriched organic or inorganic materials. While inorganic materials can be separated from MPs using density separation, the organic fraction impedes the ability to conduct reliable analyses. Hence, the purification of MPs from organic materials is crucial prior to conducting an identification via spectroscopic techniques. Strong acidic or alkaline treatments bear the danger of degrading sensitive synthetic polymers. We suggest an alternative method, which uses a series of technical grade enzymes for purifying MPs in environmental samples. A basic enzymatic purification protocol (BEPP) proved to be efficient while reducing 98.3 ± 0.1\% of the sample matrix in surface water samples. After showing a high recovery rate (84.5 ± 3.3\%), the BEPP was successfully applied to environmental samples from the North Sea where numbers of MPs range from 0.05 to 4.42 items m–3. Experiences with different environmental sample matrices were considered in an improved and universally applicable version of the BEPP, which is suitable for focal plane array detector (FPA)-based micro-FTIR analyses of water, wastewater, sediment, biota, and food samples.},

However, a reliable methodology that facilitates an automated measurement of abundance and identity of microplastics is still lacking. We present an analytical protocol that applies focal plane array detector-based infrared imaging of microplastics enriched on membrane filters applicable to investigations of microplastic pollution of the environment. Abstract The pollution of the environment with microplastics (plastic pieces {$<$}5 mm) is a problem of increasing concern. However, although this has been generally recognised by scientists and authorities, the analysis of microplastics is often done by visual inspection alone with potentially high error rates, especially for smaller particles. Methods that allow for a fast and reliable analysis of microplastics enriched on filters are lacking. Our study is the first to fill this gap by using focal plane array detector-based micro-Fourier-transform infrared imaging for analysis of microplastics from environmental samples. As a result of our iteratively optimised analytical approach (concerning filter material, measuring mode, measurement parameters and identification protocol), we were able to successfully measure the whole surface ({$>$}10-mm diameter) of filters with microplastics from marine plankton and sediment samples. The measurement with a high lateral resolution allowed for the detection of particles down to a size of 20 μm in only a fractional part of time needed for chemical mapping. The integration of three band regions facilitated the pre-selection of potential microplastics of the ten most important polymers. Subsequent to the imaging the review of the infrared spectra of the pre-selected potential microplastics was necessary for a verification of plastic polymer origin. The approach we present here is highly suitable to be implemented as a standard procedure for the analysis of small microplastics from environmental samples. However, a further automatisation with respect to measurement and subsequent particle identification would facilitate the even faster and fully automated analysis of microplastic samples.},

  abstract = {Plastic debris are resistant to degradation, and therefore tend to accumulate in marine environment. Nevertheless recent estimations of plastic concentrations at the surface of the ocean were lower than expected leading the communities to seek new sinks. Among the different processes suggested we chose to focus on the transport of microplastics from the surface to deeper layers of the ocean via phytoplankton aggregates that constitute most of the sinking flux. Interactions between microplastics and aggregates were studied by building a new device: the flow-through roller tank that mimics the behaviour of laboratory made aggregates sinking through a dense layer of microplastics. Three types of aggregates formed from two different algae species (the diatom Chaetoceros neogracile, the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina and a mix) were used as model. With their frustule made of biogenic silica which is denser than the organic matter, diatom aggregates sunk faster than R. salina aggregates. Diatom aggregates were on average bigger and stickier while aggregates from R. salina were smaller and more fragile. With higher concentrations measured in R. salina aggregates, all model-aggregates incorporated and concentrated microplastics, substantially increasing the microplastic sinking rates from tenths to hundreds of metres per day. Our results clearly show that marine aggregates can be an efficient sink for microplastics by influencing their vertical distribution in the water column. Furthermore, despite the high plastic concentrations tested, our study opens new questions regarding the impact of plastics on sedimentation fluxes in oceans. As an effect of microplastic incorporation, the sinking rates of diatom aggregates strongly decreased meanwhile the sinking rates of cryptophyte aggregates increased.},

However, the behaviour of MP with marine phytoplanktonic cells remains little studied and thus unpredictable. The present study assessed the potential for phytoplankton cells to form hetero-aggregates with small micro-polystyrene (micro-PS) particles depending on microalgal species and physiological status. A prymnesiophycea, Tisochrysis lutea, a dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa triquetra, and a diatom, Chaetoceros neogracile, were exposed to micro-PS (2~μm diameter; 3.96~μg~L−1) during their growth culture cycles. Micro-PS were quantified using an innovative flow-cytometry approach, which allowed the monitoring of the micro-PS repartition in microalgal cultures and the distinction between free suspended micro-PS and hetero-aggregates of micro-PS and microalgae. Hetero-aggregation was observed for C.~neogracile during the stationary growth phase. The highest levels of micro-PS were “lost” from solution, sticking to flasks, with T.~lutea and H.~triquetra cultures. This loss of micro-PS sticking to the flask walls increased with the age of the culture for both species. No effects of micro-PS were observed on microalgal physiology in terms of growth and chlorophyll fluorescence. Overall, these results highlight the potential for single phytoplankton cells and residual organic matter to interact with microplastics, and thus potentially influence their distribution and bioavailability in experimental systems and the water column.},

  abstract = {The effect of a recent vegetation change ({$<$}100 years) from C-4 grassland to C-3 woodland in central Queensland, Australia, on soil organic matter (SOM) composition and SOM dynamics has been investigated using a novel coupled thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry-quadrupole.mass spectrometry-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (TG-DSC-QMS-IRMS) system. TG-DSC-QMS-IRMS distinguishes the C isotope composition of discrete SOM pools, showing changes in labile, recalcitrant and refractory carbon in the bulk soil and particle size fractions which track the vegetation changes. Analysis of evolved gases (by QMS) from thermal decomposition, rather than observed weight loss, proved essential in determining the temperature at which SOM decomposes, because smectite and kaolinite clays contribute to observed weight losses. The delta C-13 analyses of the CO2 evolved at different temperatures for bulk soil and particle size-separates showed that most of the labile SOM under the more recent woody vegetation was C-3-derived carbon whereas the delta C-13 values in the recalcitrant SOM showed greater C-4 contributions. This indicated a shift from grass (C-4)- to tree (C-3)-derived carbon in the woodland, which was also supported by the two-phase C-13 enrichment with depth, i.e. C-3 vegetation dominated the top soil (0-10 cm), but the C-4 contribution increased with depth (more gradual). This is perturbed by the inclusion of charcoal from forest fires (C-14 age incursions) and by the deep incorporation of C-3 carbon due to root penetration.

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution within the marine environment is of pressing concern globally. Accordingly, spatial monitoring of microplastic concentrations, composition and size distribution may help to identify sources and entry pathways, and hence allow initiating focused mitigation. Spatial distribution patterns of microplastics were investigated in two compartments of the southern North Sea by collecting sublittoral sediment and surface water samples from 24 stations. Large microplastics (500−5000 μm) were detected visually and identified using attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The remaining sample was digested enzymatically, concentrated onto filters and analyzed for small microplastics (11−500 μm) using Focal Plane Array (FPA) FTIR imaging. Microplastics were detected in all samples with concentrations ranging between 2.8 and 1188.8 particles kg−1 for sediments and 0.1–245.4 particles m−3 for surface waters. On average 98\% of microplastics were {$<$}100 μm in sediments and 86\% in surface waters. The most prevalent polymer types in both compartments were polypropylene, acrylates/polyurethane/varnish, and polyamide. However, polymer composition differed significantly between sediment and surface water samples as well as between the Frisian Islands and the English Channel sites. These results show that microplastics are not evenly distributed, in neither location nor size, which is illuminating regarding the development of monitoring protocols.},

However, we currently have no information about potential effects on plant community productivity and structure. In a plant community consisting of seven plant species that co-occur in temperate grassland ecosystems, we thus investigated the effect of microplastics (i.e., microfibers) and drought, a factor with which microfibers might interact, on plant productivity and community structure. Our results showed that at the community level, shoot and root mass decreased with drought but increased with microfibers, an effect likely linked to reduced soil bulk density, improved aeration and better penetration of roots in the soil. Additionally, we observed that microfibers affected plant community structure. Species such as Calamagrostis, invasive in Europe, and the allelophatic Hieracium, became more dominant with microfibers, while species that potentially have the ability to facilitate the establishment of other plant species (e.g., Holcus), decreased in biomass. As microfibers affect plant species dominance, examining cascade effects on ecosystem functions should be a high priority for future research.},

  abstract = {Microplastics in soils have become an important threat for terrestrial systems as they may potentially alter the geochemical/biophysical soil environment and can interact with drought. As microplastics may affect soil water content, this could exacerbate the well-known negative effects of drought on ecosystem functionality. Thus, functions including litter decomposition, soil aggregation or those related with nutrient cycling can be altered. Despite this potential interaction, we know relatively little about how microplastics, under different soil water conditions, affect ecosystem functions and multifunctionality. To address this gap, we performed an experiment using grassland plant communities growing in microcosms. Microplastic fibres (absent, present) and soil water conditions (well-watered, drought) were applied in a fully factorial design. At harvest, we measured soil ecosystem functions related to nutrient cycling (β-glucosaminidase, β-D-cellobiosidase, phosphatase, β-glucosidase enzymes), respiration, nutrient retention, pH, litter decomposition and soil aggregation (water stable aggregates). As terrestrial systems provide these functions simultaneously, we also assessed ecosystem multifunctionality, an index that encompasses the array of ecosystem functions measured here. We found that the interaction between microplastic fibres and drought affected ecosystem functions and multifunctionality. Drought had negatively affected nutrient cycling by decreasing enzymatic activities by up to 39\%, while microplastics increased soil aggregation by 18\%, soil pH by 4\% and nutrient retention by up to 70\% by diminishing nutrient leaching. Microplastic fibres also impacted soil enzymes, respiration and ecosystem multifunctionality, but importantly, the direction of these effects depended on soil water status. That is, under well-watered conditions, these functions decreased with microplastic fibres by up to 34\% while under drought they had similar values irrespective of the microplastic presence, or tended to increase with microplastics. Litter decomposition had a contrary pattern increasing with microplastics by 6\% under well-watered conditions while decreasing to a similar percentage under drought. Synthesis and applications. Single ecosystem functions can be positively or negatively affected by microplastics fibres depending on soil water status. However, our results suggest that microplastic fibres may cause negative effects on ecosystem soil multifunctionality of a similar magnitude as drought. Thus, strategies to counteract this new global change factor are necessary.},

However, little is known about the effects that microplastics of different shapes, polymers and concentration may have on soil properties and plant performance. To address this, we selected twelve microplastics representing different shapes (fibers, films, foams, fragments) and polymers, and mixed them each with soil at a concentration of 0.1\%, 0.2\%, 0.3\%, 0,4\%. A phytometer (Daucus carota) grew in each pot during four weeks. Shoot, root mass, soil aggregation and microbial activity were measured. All shapes increased plant biomass. Shoot mass increased by \textasciitilde{} 27\% with fibers, \textasciitilde{} 60\% with films, \textasciitilde{} 45\% with foams and by \textasciitilde 54\% with fragments, as fibers hold water in the soil for longer, films decrease soil bulk density, foams and fragments can increase soil aeration and macroporosity, which overall promote plant performance. By contrast, all shapes decreased soil aggregation by \textasciitilde 25\% as microplastics may introduce fracture points into aggregates and due to potential negative effects on soil biota. The latter may also explain the decrease in microbial activity with, for example, polyethylene films. Our findings show that shape, polymer type and concentration are key properties when studying microplastic effects on terrestrial systems.},

Five soil samples from different provinces in China were selected (named Harbin S1, Huainan S2, Jiangxi S3, Shaanxi S4 and Hainan S5, respectively) and their interaction characteristics and mechanism with PSMPs were investigated, which provided new insights into the environmental behavior of microplastics.

The sorption isotherm data of PSMPs on soils fit a linear model well (R2~=~0.998). The sorption of MPs on soils was affected by pH, and the sorption ability weakened as the pH increased. Soil physicochemical properties play important roles in sorption of PSMPs, especially the content of soil organic carbon. The sorption capacity was positively correlated with soil organic carbon (R2~=~0.999) and Fe2O3 content (R2~=~0.967), while the sorption of clay showed opposite trend (R2~=~0.952). The sorption mechanisms of PSMPs on soils included surface sorption, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.

The three treatments included non-mulched (CK), gravel-mulched (GM) and plastic film-mulched (FM). After the 4-year duration, compared with the initial SOC stock, the SOC stock under GM decreased 0.97~Mg~C~hm−2 whereas under FM increased 1.14~Mg~C~hm−2 in the 20–40~cm layer. Across the 0–40~cm layer, the SOC stock under GM significantly decreased, whereas under FM demonstrated some tendency to increase. In contrast to the CK, the FM treatment significantly increased light fraction organic C (LFOC) content (density \&lt;1.7~g~cm−3) by 17.2~mg~kg−1 in the 20–40~cm layer. Although, the FM treatment significantly decreased the CMI in the 0–20~cm layer, compared with the CK, but an increased trend of CMI in the 20–40~cm layer was observed. KMnO4-oxidized organic C and LFOC were more sensitive than other C fractions in comparison of relative changes for labile SOC fractions. In conclusion, plastic film mulching could be the best option for sustainably enhancing crop productivity and maintaining soil quality in the semiarid regions of northwest China.},

Although research methods on microplastics in the environment have been reported extensively, the data on microplastics obtained cannot be comparable due to different methods. In this work, we critically reviewed the analytical methods of microplastics, including sample collection, separation, identification, and quantification. Manta trawl and tweezers or cassette corers are used to collect water samples and sediments, respectively. For biota sample, internal organs need to be dissected and separated to obtain microplastics. Density differences are often used to separate microplastics from the sample matrix. Visual classification is one of the most common methods for identifying microplastics, and it can be better detected by combining it with other instruments. However, they are not suitable for detection nanoplastics, which may lead to underestimation of risk. The abundance of microplastics varies with the detection method. Thus, the analytical methods for microplastics need to be standardized as soon as possible. Meanwhile, new methods for analyzing nanoplastics are urgently needed. Practitioner points Sampling, separation, identification, and quantification are important procedures. The sampling and separation methods for microplastics need to be standardized. The organic matter can be removed by digestion to facilitate identification. Combine microscope with analytical instruments to better identify microplastics.

Microplastic effects have been intensely studied in aquatic, especially marine systems; however, there is lack of studies focusing on effects on soil and its biota. A basic question is if and how surface-deposited microplastic particles are transported into the soil. We here wished to test if soil microarthropods, using Collembola, can transport these particles over distances of centimeters within days in a highly controlled experimental set-up. We conducted a fully factorial experiment with two collembolan species of differing body size, Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta, in combination with urea-formaldehyde particles of two different particle sizes. We observed significant differences between the species concerning the distance the particles were transported. F.~candida was able to transport larger particles further and faster than P.~minuta. Using video, we observed F.~candida interacting with urea-formaldehyde particles and polyethylene terephthalate fibers, showing translocation of both material types. Our data clearly show that microplastic particles can be moved and distributed by soil microarthropods. Although we did not observe feeding, it is possible that microarthropods contribute to the accumulation of microplastics in the soil food web.},

Should negative outcomes in these areas arise as a consequence of plastic pollution, they will be practically irreversible. Potential impacts from poorly reversible plastic pollution include changes to carbon and nutrient cycles; habitat changes within soils, sediments, and aquatic ecosystems; co-occurring biological impacts on endangered or keystone species; ecotoxicity; and related societal impacts. The rational response to the global threat posed by accumulating and poorly reversible plastic pollution is to rapidly reduce plastic emissions through reductions in consumption of virgin plastic materials, along with internationally coordinated strategies for waste management.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Amongst the different plasticizers used, more attention is paid to di (2-ethylhexylphtalate) (DEHP), one of the most representative compounds as it exhibits predominant effects on environment and human health. Meanwhile, several questions related to its sources; toxicity, distribution and fate still remain unanswered. Most of the evidence until date suggests that DEHP is an omnipresent compound found in different ecological compartments and its higher hydrophobicity and low volatility have resulted in significant adsorption to solids matrix. In fact, there are important issues to be addressed with regard to the toxicity of this compound in both animals and humans, its behavior in different ecological systems, and the transformation products generated during different biological or advanced chemical treatments.

This research was conducted to determine the effects of different synthetic polymers and biopolymers at low concentration (0.03 \% - 1\%) at arid and semi arid soil of North Africa. Polystyrene, Polyacrylamide; Cellulose and the mixture of Polyacrylamide with other polymers were characterized by viscosity, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray Diffractometry, thermal analysis (TG and DSC) and Scanning electron micrographs (SEM). The results showed that the polymer composites (10 mg /L Polyacrylamide and 0.5g / L Cellulose) in soil could improve better soil physical properties and augment 60 \% water retention at arid soils compared with application of any other polymer at the same concentration. This work can help to improve the productivity of arid and semi arid soils by using low concentration of biopolymers from plant fibers and polymers from synthetic plastics compounds or wastes plastic industry to augment water holding capacity improve the physical properties of soils by binding soils particles together reducing the losses of water by evaporation and deep percoloration, and to make valuable products of plastic industry and renewable organic fibers to protect environment.},

The mulching techniques were being used widely in irrigated crop production worldwide. The mulching techniques can be also implemented in summer vegetables production under rain-fed conditions. The current study aimed at evaluating the effect of polyethylene black plastic mulch on growth and yield of okra, Abelmoschus esculentus and summer squash, Cucurbita pepo L. under rain-fed conditions of Jordan. Two field experiments were conducted during summer growing season at Al-Rabbah Agricultural Research Station, Mutah University, Jordan. Soil cover treatments were polyethylene black plastic mulch and no mulch (bare soil). The results indicated that the mulched plots had higher soil moisture content than bare soil plots, which has positively reflected on vegetative and yield parameters. Using polyethylene plastic mulch had pronounced positive effect on yield of okra and squash as compared to bare soil. Early, middle, late and total yield of both vegetable crops were significantly increased in plots covered with plastic mulch. In addition, fruit number and weight had also an increasing trend as fruit yield. Plots covered with black plastic mulch were produced higher fresh and dry weights of both vegetable crops. It ban be concluded that using black plastic mulch as a soil cover increased okra and squash vegetative growth and yield under rain-fed conditions.},

The partitioning of MPs through the settlement processes of wastewater treatment results in the majority becoming entrained in the sewage sludge. This study characterized MPs in sludge samples from seven WWTPs in Ireland which use anaerobic digestion (AD), thermal drying (TD), or lime stabilization (LS) treatment processes. Abundances ranged from 4196 to 15 385 particles kg–1 (dry weight). Results of a general linear mixed model (GLMM) showed significantly higher abundances of MPs in smaller size classes in the LS samples, suggesting that the treatment process of LS shears MP particles. In contrast, lower abundances of MPs found in the AD samples suggests that this process may reduce MP abundances. Surface morphologies examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed characteristics of melting and blistering of TD MPs and shredding and flaking of LS MPs. This study highlights the potential for sewage sludge treatment processes to affect the risk of MP pollution prior to land spreading and may have implications for legislation governing the application of biosolids to agricultural land.},

The disposal of plastics, especially those used in packaging, poses a serious challenge to waste management. Growing environmental awareness has imposed a paradigm shift from biostable materials to biodegradable ones that are compatible with the environment to ensure a safe eco-friendly atmosphere for packaging film and processes. The ever-increasing use of plastic film nowadays has resulted in biodegradability becoming an essential characteristic for plastics. An additional advantage of using biodegradable materials is that upon disintegration and composting, they may act as fertilizers and soil conditioners, enhancing crop yield while capitalizing natural resource conservation with an underpinning on environment friendly and safer atmosphere. This review article is thus an attempt to address this pressing problem by discussing a few biodegradable polymeric blends derived from renewable feedstocks with potential applications in our everyday lives.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cultivation and grassland type on light fraction and total C and N in a Dark Brown Chernozemic  soil. Three paired-sets of soil samples, in five replications, were collected from three cultivated field areas under annual crops [mostly wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)] and from three adjacent grassland areas. The three sets were a 30-yr-old bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.)/alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) dominated stand cut annually for hay (Lm) and cultivated area 1 (Ct1), an unbroken native grass stand having no vegetation removed (Ng) and cultivated area 2 (Ct2) and a bromegrass/crested wheatgrass (A gropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.) dominated stand on a land reverted to grassland 60 yr ago having no vegetation removed (Og) and cultivated area 3 (Ct3). Soil samples from the 0- to 5-cm, 5- to 10-cm, 10- to 15-cm, 15- to 20-cm and 20- to 30-cm depths were taken using a 4-cm-diameter coring tube sampler. Total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), light fraction organic C (LFOC) and light fraction N (LFN) in soil were determined and the equivalent mass technique was used to calculate their masses in different soil layers. Total mass (for all soil layers) was less in the cultivated areas compared to the grassland areas by 31 to 43\% for TOC, by 84 to 85\% for LFOC, by 15 to 34\% for TN and by 82 to 84\% for LFN. The effect of cultivation was much greater in the surface 5-cm depth compared to deeper soil layers. The proportions of LFOC in TOC and LFN in TN as well as the TOC:TN ratios were lower in the cultivated areas than in the grassland areas, whereas the LFOC:LFN ratios were similar in cultivated and grassland areas. The light fractions of C and N were thus more responsive to change from grassland to cultivation of annual crops compared to the total C and N. Within the grassland areas, the mass of TOC and TN in most of the soil layers was greater in the Lm compared to both Ng and Og areas, while the LFOC and LFN did not show the effect of grassland type. The differences in the mass of both total and light fraction C and N in the cultivated areas were small and generally not significant.

  abstract = {Soil proteomics, the large-scale characterization of the entire protein complement in soils, provides a promising approach for deciphering the role of microbial functioning in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the extraction of soil proteins in sufficient quantities and of adequate purity remains a challenging task mainly due to the co-extraction of interfering humic substances. Up to now, the treatment of soil extracts with liquid phenol has been the “gold standard” for reducing humics, while the NoviPure cleanup kit was recently launched as a non-toxic approach. The present study describes an alternative method for delivering high-purity proteins based on humic coagulation with trivalent aluminum ions (Al3+). Various experimental parameters were optimized individually in order to maximize protein yield and diminish co-extracted humics. The optimized method was applied on a set of soil samples with diverse physicochemical characteristics and a comparison with the other two techniques was conducted. The amount of residual humics resulting from Al3+-based method was 26 and 35\% higher than that from phenol treatment and NoviPure Kit, respectively, but these differences were of marginal statistical significance. With regard to extracted proteins, the average yields of the three methods were comparable, without showing any statistically significant differences. Overall, humic coagulation with Al3+ offers comparable cleanup performance in terms of protein yield and purity, but it is less toxic and less complex than the phenol-partitioning method, whereas it is far less expensive than the NoviPure Kit. The new technique is expected to facilitate the implementation of proteomic studies in soils.},

The present study identifies, characterizes, and quantifies the microplastics in groundwater samples around Perungudi and Kodungaiyur municipal solid waste dumpsites in South India. To evaluate and assess the microplastic abundance, characteristics (composite, size, colour, shape, and surface morphology), detection methods of plastic particles, and potential risk factors from the absorption of microplastic in groundwater. Further, the microplastic particle classification was performed using LB-340 Zoom Stereo Microscope with LED Illumination, ATR-FTIR fitted with SEM with EDX analyzer. The groundwater samples (n~=~20) were found contaminated with microplastic particles in the range of 2–80 items/L with coloured particles, white (38\%), black (27\%), green (8\%), red (18\%), blue (6\%), and yellow (2\%). The polymer type was found to occur in the following order: nylon (70\%), pellets (18\%), foam (6\%), fragments (3\%), fibers/PVC (2\%), and polythene (1\%). In both sampling sites, 90\% of microplastics are derived from the buried plastics and waste fragmentation which are predominantly of polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS). Micro and nano plastics abundance in groundwater is of paramount importance as it has a major impact on human health. This study throws light on the characteristics and quantification of the microplastics in groundwater that initiates further research by which microplastics enter into the environment.},

Although as much as 80\% of marine debris originates from land, little attention was given to the role of rivers as debris pathways to the sea. Worldwide, not a single great river has yet been studied for the surface microplastics load over its length. We report the abundance and composition of microplastics at the surface of the Rhine, one of the largest European rivers. Measurements were made at 11 locations over a stretch of 820 km. Microplastics were found in all samples, with 892,777 particles km(-2) on average. In the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, a peak concentration of 3.9 million particles km(-2) was measured. Microplastics concentrations were diverse along and across the river, reflecting various sources and sinks such as waste water treatment plants, tributaries and weirs. Measures should be implemented to avoid and reduce the pollution with anthropogenic litter in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are emerging pollutants in water bodies worldwide. The environmental entry areas must be studied to localise their sources and develop preventative and remedial solutions. Rivers are major contributors to the marine microplastics load. Here, we focus on a specific type of plastic microbead (diameter 286–954 μm, predominantly opaque, white–beige) that was repeatedly identified in substantial numbers between kilometres 677 and 944 of the Rhine River, one of Europe's main waterways. Specifically, we aimed (i) to confirm the reported abrupt increase in microbead concentrations between the cities of Leverkusen and Duisburg and (ii) to assess the concentration gradient of these particles along this stretch at higher resolution. Furthermore, we set out (iii) to narrow down the putative entry stretch from 81.3 km, as reported in an earlier study, to less than 20 km according to our research design, and (iv) to identify the chemical composition of the particles and possibly reveal their original purpose. Surface water filtration (mesh: 300 μm, n = 9) at regular intervals along the focal river stretch indicated the concentration of these spherules increased from 0.05 to 8.3 particles m−3 over 20 km. This spot sampling approach was supported by nine suspended solid samples taken between 2014 and 2017, encompassing the river stretch between Leverkusen and Duisburg. Ninety-five percent of microbeads analysed (202/212) were chemically identified as crosslinked polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB, 146/212) or polystyrene (PS, 56/212) via Raman or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Based on interpretation of polymer composition, surface structure, shape, size and colour, the PS(-DVB) microbeads are likely to be used ion-exchange resins, which are commonly applied in water softening and various industrial purification processes.

  abstract = {This mini review identifies several thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)-based methods for the identification and quantification of different microplastics in both proof-of-concept studies and environmental samples, and highlights method-specific limitations associated with their application. Well-separated and non-overlapping melting peaks are a conditional requirement for the identification and quantification of microplastics using thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC). Other TGA-based methods, such as coupled Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR) or mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), as well as thermal extraction desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TED-GC-MS), are dependent on the presence of at least one unique thermal degradation product for use as a marker in the identification and quantification process. Varying degrees of time expenditure and complexity of analysis are present within the reviewed methods, with one consistent factor underlying the evaluation: an underutilization of information extracted from the TGA signal itself. As such, in this mini-review, we advocate the development of methods in which stand-alone TGA can be applied towards the chemical identification of microplastics. Although the main hindrance to this is the presence of overlapping thermal transitions, stand-alone TGA has long been used as a routine and robust method for the analysis of polymers, and methods for optimizing the resolution of complex mixtures are available. Current results in literature emphasize the complementarity of analysis methods, and TGA has potential to play a role as a rapid and facile method that can guide the chemical identification of polymers and address needs of current methods.},

Determination was performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), whereas high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was used for quinmerac. In all substrates linearity was evaluated using matrix-matched calibration samples at five concentration levels (50–1000 ng L−1 for water, 5–500 μg kg−1 for soil and 2.5–500 μg kg−1 for sunflower or oilseed rape plant). Correlation coefficient was higher than 0.992 for all pesticides in all substrates. Acceptable mean recovery values were obtained for all pesticides in water (65.4–108.8\%), soil (70.0–110.0\%) and plant (66.1–118.6\%), with intra- and inter-day RSD\% below 20\%. LODs were in the range of 0.250–26.6 ng L−1 for water, 0.10–1.8 μg kg−1 for soil and 0.15–2.0 μg kg−1 for plants.

Such critical effects, combined with the ubiquity of EDCs in sewage effluent and potentially in tapwater, have led to concerns that they could be major physiological disruptors for wildlife and more controversially for humans. Although sewage effluent is known to be a rich source of EDCs, there is as yet no evidence for EDC uptake by invertebrates that live within the sewage treatment system. Here, we describe the use of an extraction method and GC–MS for the first time to determine levels of EDCs (e.g., dibutylphthalate, dioctylphthalate, bisphenol-A and 17β-estradiol) in tissue samples from earthworms (Eisenia fetida) living in sewage percolating filter beds and garden soil. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such use of these techniques to determine EDCs in tissue samples in any organism. We found significantly higher concentrations of these chemicals in the animals from sewage percolating filter beds. Our data suggest that earthworms can be used as bioindicators for EDCs in these substrates and that the animals accumulate these compounds to levels well above those reported for waste water. The potential transfer into the terrestrial food chain and effects on wildlife are discussed.},

  abstract = {In Spain, desertification has been-and is still-mainly associated with soil erosion, particularly in natural and semi-natural systems. Such association cannot be supported either from the scientific or the socio-economic point of view. Most average values of erosion rates in Spain have been overestimated, especially in the case of natural systems. High rates of soil erosion in natural systems are usually restricted to spatially limited areas like badlands, most of them generated through active natural geomorphologic processes. The main erosion problems are not found in natural environments but in agricultural systems, especially in marginal agricultural areas on steep slopes and with bad agricultural practices and also in intensively irrigated lands, especially greenhouses. The association of and zones with the ancient destruction of vegetation is rooted in simplistic ideas considering areas with scarce vegetation, little biomass or limited height to be generated by negative human interventions. However, in and and semiarid systems this is not always true. The simplistic ideas linking scarce vegetation with desertification is also deeply negative for the conservation of the outstanding biodiversity of and systems, most of them included in the European Habitat Directive. The main desertification problem in Spain is generated by unsustainable water management. The current expansion of irrigated lands outside the areas suited for agriculture is increasing the intensity of aquifer exploitation, already causing serious problems of salinization, the loss of springs and wetlands and associated biodiversity and the exhaustion of non-renewable groundwater resources.

The scope of this paper is also to give an overview of the present state of faster GC instrumentation which is already available for trace analysis. The practicality of fast CGC is a function of sample preparation and the matrix interferences and how they affect the resultant resolution that may be achieved. Researchers have demonstrated the applicability of fast GC to trace and ultratrace analysis of volatile and semivolatile compounds also with narrow bore columns and difficult sample matrices (such as food, and soil extract). The main development of faster GC methods has been observed in the field of environmental analysis. Practical applications are presented. Both optimised sample preparation and experimental conditions for faster GC are the future perspective of trace analysis.},

  abstract = {Microplastics pollution is an acknowledged global issue, and new strategies are required to meet the increasing demand of standardized, fast and reliable measurements. Analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) is a promising technique to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on microplastics mixtures through the selection of a set of characteristic pyrolysis products for each polymer. However, this data processing method is time-consuming, and no automated algorithms are currently available. In the present work, a new method for the qualitative analysis of eleven types of synthetic polymers was developed, automated and implemented in the F-Search software, with the aim of proposing a standardized procedure for data processing in Py-GC/MS analysis of plastics mixtures. The method improves on the current literature, and is based on the generation of summated mass spectra (SMS) for each polymer, obtained by extracting specific m/z and retention index coordinates corresponding to characteristic pyrolysis products. The identification of a polymer is performed by comparing its SMS with those of a built-in library. After validation, the algorithm was tested on a reference sample containing all eleven investigated polymers. The algorithm provided relative standard deviations around 10\%, and the results were used to estimate the lowest amount of polymer detectable in a sample, which was found lower than 1 μg for most polymers. The performance of the algorithm was also evaluated on a real sample from ocean water trawling, providing positive results for four different polymers. The performances of the algorithm are discussed, and possible future developments are outlined.},

In the literature, one finds mixed results when attempting to determine the major environmental and biological controls on soil microbial structure and functionality. The objectives of this research were to: (1) Qualitatively and quantitatively measure seasonal and antecedent soil management effects on the soil microbial community structure in the rhizosphere of a subsequent tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum) and (2) Determine phylum scale differences between the rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial community as influenced by the antecedent hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), cereal rye (Secale cereale), or black plastic mulch treatments. In this report, we use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the 16s rDNA gene to characterize changes in microbial community structure in soil samples from a field replicated tomato production system experiment at USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD, USA. We found season of the year had the strongest influence on the soil microbial community structure of some of the major microbial phyla. Although we monitored just a few of the major microbial phyla (four Eubacteria and Archaea), we found that the effects of the tomato plant on the structural composition of these phyla in the rhizosphere differed dependent on the antecedent cover crop. Increased understanding of how agricultural factors influence the soil microbial community structure under field conditions is critical information for farmers and land managers to make decisions when targeting soil ecosystem services that are microbially driven.},

However, soil biodegradable mulch films incorporated into the soil through tillage, being not only a physical but also a biogeochemical input, is expected to influence the soil quality by affecting its functions. Therefore, the eco-compatibility of these biodegradable plastics needs to be evaluated for their impact on different soil functions. To understand the effect of biodegradable plastics on soil quality (i.e. microbial biomass, nitrogen cycle, and activity of soil enzymes involved in the biochemical processes of carbon and nitrogen), we added increasing quantities of biodegradable plastics in two different soils: a loamy (Cambisol) and sandy (Arenosol) soil. The results highlight that the carbon added through the biodegradable plastics influenced the processes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycles. Significant effects were observed mainly with the highest dose of biodegradable plastics added (1\%), resulting in a higher growth of microbial biomass, increased carbon mineralisation, and increased immobilisation of available nitrogen. The results also underline the importance of evaluating the impact of biodegradable plastics in different soils because all the processes considered are also influenced also by soil physicochemical characteristics.},

  abstract = {The surge in the use of plastic materials, its poor handling and disposal have led to an increase in microplastic pollution in terrestrial environments. Microplastic pollution in soils is of concern due to potential influences on soil properties which play a critical role in plant growth and soil fertility. Moreover, the soil environment is a key nexus linking the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere, and thus represents a crucial conduit for pollutant migration from the anthroposphere. In this review we evaluate the effects of microplastics in the soil environment with a specific focus on physical properties and biological function in the rhizosphere. Our review reveals that agricultural sources, particularly plastic mulches and waste applications, represent the main source of soil microplastic inputs. Once in the soil environment, microplastic effects on soil properties are highly variable depending mainly on soil type and microplastic characteristics. Soil properties relating to erosion-risk (i.e., bulk density), structural integrity (i.e., aggregate stability, particularly micro-aggregate stability), and water-storage capacity (i.e., evaporation rate, desiccation) are generally adversely impacted by soil microplastic inputs. Soil microplastic effects on rhizosphere function (i.e., plant health and microbial activity) are remarkably varied with some studies revealing positive impacts, such as enhanced plant-symbiotic fungi associations, from soil plastic additions. However, all identified publications reported at least one detrimental MP-induced impact on plant responses. Finally, our review revealed associations between microplastic properties and soil functional parameters – in particular, polymer size and morphology control soil water-holding properties whereas polymer type influences plant response. These associations will be helpful in targeting future research directions on this important topic that intersects all of the Earth's spheres.},

Microplastic interacts with biota, including microorganisms, in these habitats, raising concerns about its ecological effects. Rivers may transport microplastic to marine habitats and the Great Lakes, but data on microplastic in rivers is limited. In a highly urbanized river in Chicago, Illinois, USA, we measured concentrations of microplastic that met or exceeded those measured in oceans and the Great Lakes, and we demonstrated that wastewater treatment plant effluent was a point source of microplastic. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastic within the river were less diverse and were significantly different in taxonomic composition compared to those from the water column and suspended organic matter. Several taxa that include plastic decomposing organisms and pathogens were more abundant on microplastic. These results demonstrate that microplastic in rivers are a distinct microbial habitat and may be a novel vector for the downstream transport of unique bacterial assemblages. In addition, this study suggests that urban rivers are an overlooked and potentially significant component of the global microplastic life cycle.},

  abstract = {Within the last decade the production of plastic steadily increased and so did the amount of plastic waste. When bigger plastic pieces enter the environment, they are fragmented over time due to mechanical and environmental forces. The occurring and the directly released microplastic cause severe problems on soil organisms, due to alteration of physical properties and chemical interactions in the habitat. Main emissions sources of microplastic are different kinds of abrasions (road traffic, packaging, fibers of textiles during washing), waste disposal and drifts. Remains of mulching foils and protection nets spoil agricultural soil as well as the application of compost, sewage sludge and digestate, which may contain microplastic. Once released, microplastic accumulates much stronger in terrestrial than in aquatic systems. Spectroscopic, microscopic and thermo-analytical methods are commonly used to analyze microplastic in soil. The main challenges are to differentiate between soil matrix and plastic particles and to get rid of disturbing organic compounds. Unfortunately, there is no soil without plastic, no environmental blind sample to allow the finding of method limits. Inter-laboratory cooperation and data collection should allow estimation and comparison of emissions not only on European but on global scale. Investigations of Austrian samples provided a first orientation for regulations and measures to avoid further environmental pollution.},

  abstract = {Background Inappropriate disposal of the plastic mulching debris could create macroplastics (MaPs) and microplastics (MiPs) pollution in agricultural soil. Methods To study the effects of farming systems on accumulation and distribution of agricultural plastic debris, research was carried out on two farming systems in Northwest China. Farming in Wutong Village (S1) is characterized by small plots and low-intensity machine tillage while farming in Shihezi (S2) is characterized by large plots and high-intensity machine tillage. In September 2017, we selected six fields in S1, three fields with 6–8 years of continuous plastic mulching (CM) as well as three fields with over 30 years of intermittent mulching (IM). In S2, we selected five cotton fields with 6, 7, 8, 15 and 18 years of continuous mulching. In both regions, MaPs and MiPs from soil surface to 30 cm depth (0–30 cm) were sampled. Results The results showed that in S1, MaPs mass in fields with 6–8 years CM (i.e., 97.4kg·ha−1) were significantly higher than in fields with 30 years IM (i.e., 53.7 kg·ha−1). MaPs in size category of 10–50 cm2 accounted for 46.9\% in fields of CM and 44.5\% in fields of IM of total collected MaPs number. In S2, MaPs mass ranged from 43.5 kg·ha−1 to 148 kg·ha−1. MaPs in size category of 2–10 cm2 account for 41.1\% of total collected MaPs number while 0.25–2 cm2 accounted for 40.6\%. MiPs in S1 were mainly detected in fields with over 30 years of intermittent mulching (up to 2,200 particles·kg−1 soil), whereas in S2 were detected in all fields (up to 900 particles·kg−1 soil). The results indicated farming systems could substantially affect the accumulation and distribution of agricultural plastic debris. Continuous plastic mulching could accumulate higher amount of MaPs than intermittent plastic mulching. High-intensity machine tillage could lead to higher fragmentation of MaPs and more severe MiPs pollution. These results suggest that agricultural plastic regulations are needed.},

This study investigated the applicability of a combination of Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (STA), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR), and Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) in the detection and quantification of tire particles from formulated sediments. FTIR spectral data were obtained by heating 20 samples in STA. Among the 20 samples, 12 were tire granules in formulated sediments (TGIS) containing 1\%, 2\%, 5\%, and 10\% by mass of tire granules, while the remaining eight contained 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg of tire granules only (TGO). The PARAFAC models decomposed the trilinear data into three components. Tire rubber materials in tire granules (RM) and a combination of water and carbon dioxide were the components identified in all samples. The linear regression analysis of score values from the PARAFAC models showed that the RM quantity predicted were comparable to measured values in both TGIS and TGO. Decomposing the overlying components in the spectral data into different components, and predicting unknown quantity in both sample types, the method proves robust in identifying and quantifying tire particles from sediments.},

Plastic consumption expresses two sides of a coin: consumers appreciate plastic packaging for its practicability and other benefits, likewise they also experience concern especially related to pollution with waste and microplastic. In the current work, we systematically investigated valence- (Study 1; sample size [N] = 103) and risk- (Study 2; N = 105) related attitudes towards plastic packaging, plastic waste, and microplastic. Therefore, we measured participants’ attitudes implicitly and explicitly. By using single-category implicit association tests, we revealed that packaging and microplastic were automatically evaluated as ‘bad’ and neutral regarding risk, and waste as ‘bad’ and ‘risky’. Explicit responses in both studies highlighted an overall negative evaluation of all plastic forms. Thereby, packaging was rated as less ‘bad’, ‘unpleasant’, ‘unpractical’, and ‘risky’ (in general and for the environment) than waste and microplastic. The latter was evaluated as much riskier for human health than packaging and waste. Environmental risk ratings were generally very high. In comparison to other materials (paper, glass, metal), plastic was generally rated as worse and riskier. We conclude that attitudes related to plastic mirror high problem awareness and, therefore, plastic-reduction interventions should support consumers in acting according to their attitudes rather than addressing only awareness and attitude change.},

Here, eight commercial polymers selected from biodegradable to environmentally persistent materials, all formulated under a credit card format, were incubated in an outdoor compost to evaluate their fate over time and to profile the microbial communities colonizing their surfaces. After 450 days in compost, the samples were all colonized by multispecies biofilms, these latest displaying different amounts of adhered microbial biomass and significantly distinct bacterial and fungal community compositions depending on the substrate. Interestingly, colonization experiments on the eight polymers revealed a large core of shared microbial taxa, predominantly composed of microorganisms previously reported from environments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons or plastics debris. These observations suggest that biofilms may contribute to the alteration process of all the polymers studied. Actually, four substrates, independently of their assignment to a polymer group, displayed a significant deterioration, which might be attributed to biologically mediated mechanisms. Relevantly, the deterioration appears strongly associated with the formation of a high-cell density biofilm onto the polymer surfaces. The analysis of various surface properties revealed that roughness and hydrophilicity are likely prominent parameters for driving the biological interactions with the polymers.},

These recommendations are based on how reliably a parameter can be measured and its importance for inter-study comparability. Furthermore, our study proposes a multidimensional vector approach, where one vector contains the information for the microplastic distribution in one sample. In this way geometric and statistical means can be used to quantitatively compare different studies. In particular, in combination with our proposed quantification procedure, a meaningful comparison of microplastic distributions across different studies becomes possible.

  abstract = {The determination of pore-size distribution (PSD) in soil by conventional methods can be time- and effort-consuming. Therefore, several attempts have been made recently to assess and implement proton nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry (1H NMR relaxometry) to determine PSDs quantitatively. The 1H NMR relaxometry promises not only to be more time- and effort-saving but also offers a broader range for the estimation of pore size, better resolved results and non-destructive measurements. To evaluate these possibilities, we tested the extent to which a single calibration curve for the estimation of surface relaxivity of soil, derived from seven soil samples, can be applied to unknown soils. For validation, the quantitative PSDs of seven additional soil samples were determined from the distributions of NMR relaxation times of water saturated samples using this calibration curve; they were compared with their classical water retention curves (WRCs). In general, the quantitative PSDs determined by this approach described the classical WRCs quite well. The best results were obtained for sandy, silty and loam soils. The largest differences were for soils with large clay (47\%) and SOM contents (10 and 21\%). Our results suggest that these differences derive from swelling processes. Highlights Can NMR relaxometry be used to quantify soil pore-size distribution without individual calibration? Soil pore size assessment by NMR is fast, detailed and independent of conventional methods NMR method describes the pore-size distribution of various soil types and soil compositions. NMR method can assess quantitative effects of SOM and swelling of clay in soil.},

Today, this plastic litter is ubiquitous in the oceans, including even remote habitats such as deep-sea sediments and polar sea ice, and it is believed to pose a threat to ecosystem health. However, the concentration of microplastics in the surface layer of the oceans is considerably lower than expected, given the ongoing replenishment of microplastics and the tendency of many plastic types to float. It has been hypothesized that microplastics leave the upper ocean by aggregation and subsequent sedimentation. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the interactions of microplastics with marine biogenic particles collected in the southwestern Baltic Sea. Our laboratory experiments revealed a large potential of microplastics to rapidly coagulate with biogenic particles, which substantiates this hypothesis. Together with the biogenic particles, the microplastics efficiently formed pronounced aggregates within a few days. The aggregation of microplastics and biogenic particles was significantly accelerated by microbial biofilms that had formed on the plastic surfaces. We assume that the demonstrated aggregation behaviour facilitates the export of microplastics from the surface layer of the oceans and plays an important role in the redistribution of microplastics in the oceans.},

  abstract = {We compare the performance of three most accepted reagents for organic matter removal: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and disodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8). Removal of organic matter from soil is mostly incomplete with the efficiency of removal depending on reaction conditions and sample properties. Generally, NaOCl and Na2S2O8 are more effective in organic C removal than H2O2 Alkaline conditions and additives favoring dispersion and/or desorption of organic matter, such as sodium pyrophosphate, seem to be crucial for C removal. Pyrophosphate and additives for pH control (bicarbonate) may irreversibly adsorb to mineral surfaces. In soils with a large proportion of organic matter bound to the mineral matrix, for example subsoils, or rich in clay-sized minerals (Fe oxides, poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases, expandable phyllosilicates), C removal can be little irrespective of the reagents used. Residual organic C seems to seems to represent largely refractory organic matter, and comprises mainly pyrogenic materials and aliphatic compounds. If protected by close association with minerals, other organic constituents such as low-molecular weight carboxylic acids, lignin-derived and N-containing compounds may escape chemical destruction. For determination of mineral phase properties, treatment with H2O2 should be avoided since it may promote organic-assisted dissolution of poorly crystalline minerals at low pH, disintegration of expandable clay minerals, and transformation of vermiculite into mica-like products due to NH4+ fixation. Sodium hypochlorite and Na2S2O8 are less harmful for minerals than H2O2 While the NaOCl procedure (pH 9.5) may dissolve Al hydroxides, alkaline conditions favor the precipitation of metals released upon destruction of organic matter. Prolonged heating to {$>$}40°C during any treatment may transform poorly crystalline minerals into more crystalline ones. Sodium hypochlorite can be used at 25°C, thus preventing heat-induced mineral alteration.},

(14.6\%), represented more than 98\% of the total catches. The specific dominance depended on the sampling date. The soil management treatment significantly affected the following parameters. (1) The overall carabid catch: the plastic mulch (5.6\% of the total catches) negatively affected total carabid collection, which was higher in the tilled (24.3\%) and herbicide-treated (21.4\%) plots, although not significantly different from the natural soil (16.5\%), straw mulch (16.3\%) and pine-bark mulch (15.9\%) treatments. (2) The specific preferences of the three most common carabids: the plastic cover adversely affected the catches of S. gallega whilst P. rufipes was collected in greater numbers in tilled areas and P. cupreus in the herbicide treatments. (3) The structure of the carabid community: based on species richness, diversity and evenness indices, herbicide and tillage provided the most diverse carabid community and the straw mulch the poorest.

  abstract = {The global presence of microplastic (MP) in aquatic ecosystems has been shown by various studies. However, neither MP concentrations nor their sources or sinks are completely known. Waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as significant point sources discharging MP to the environment. This study investigated MP in the effluents of 12 WWTPs in Lower Saxony, Germany. Samples were purified by a plastic-preserving enzymatic-oxidative procedure and subsequent density separation using a zinc chloride solution. For analysis, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) and focal plane array (FPA)-based transmission micro-FT-IR imaging were applied. This allowed the identification of polymers of all MP down to a size of 20~μm. In all effluents MP was found with quantities ranging from 0 to 5~×~101~m−3~MP~{$>~$}500~μm and 1~×~101 to 9~×~103~m−3~MP~{$<~$}500~μm. By far, polyethylene was the most frequent polymer type in both size classes. Quantities of synthetic fibres ranged from 9~×~101 to 1~×~103~m−3 and were predominantly made of polyester. Considering the annual effluxes of tested WWTPs, total discharges of 9~×~107 to 4~×~109~MP particles and fibres per WWTP could be expected. Interestingly, one tertiary WWTP had an additionally installed post-filtration that reduced the total MP discharge by 97\%. Furthermore, the sewage sludge of six WWTPs was examined and the existence of MP, predominantly polyethylene, revealed. Our findings suggest that WWTPs could be a sink but also a source of MP and thus can be considered to play an important role for environmental MP pollution.},

This books describes in three parts the methodology of analytical pyrolysis, the results of pyrolysis for a variety of biopolymers, and several practical applications of analytical pyrolysis on natural organic polymers and their composite materials. Analytical pyrolysis methodology covers two distinct subjects, the instrumentation used for pyrolysis and the analytical methods that are applied for the analysis of the pyrolysis products. A variety of pyrolytic techniques and of analytical instruments commonly coupled with pyrolysis devices are given. The description of the results of pyrolysis for biopolymers and some chemically modified natural organic polymers is the core of the book. The main pyrolysis products of numerous compounds as well as the proposed mechanisms for their pyrolysis are described. In this part an attempt is made to present as much as possible the chemistry of the pyrolytic process of natural organic polymers. The applications of analytical pyrolysis include topics such as polymer detection used for example in forensic science, structure elucidation of specific polymers, and identification of small molecules present in polymers (anti-oxidants, plasticizers, etc) Also, the degradation during heating is a subject of major interest in many practical applications regarding the physical properties of polymers. The applications to composite polymeric materials are in the fields of classification of microorganisms, study of a variety of biological samples, study of fossil materials, etc. Analytical pyrolysis can also be used for obtaining information on the burning area generate pyrolysates that have complex compositions.

The results obtained using an original technique, pyrolysis-SPME-GC/MS, are presented for cellulose. Also, the use of an internal standard in analytical pyrolysis is discussed. Regarding theoretical aspects of analytical pyrolysis, it is shown that the heating rate of most commercially available pyrolyzers is high enough for performing isothermal pyrolysis of polymers. One other aspect exemplified with original results is the preservation of certain stereochemical features from the parent compound to the pyrolytic fragments. Only one area regarding recent applications of Py-GC/MS is discussed in more detail, namely the analysis in pyrolysates of trace components related to health and environmental issues.

Given the complex nature of soils, a suitable and efficient method for standardized microplastic analysis in the soil matrix has yet to be found. This paper proposes a critical review on the different published methods for sampling, extraction, purification, and identification/quantification of microplastics in complex environmental matrices, with the main focus on their applicability for soil samples. While large microplastic particles can be manually sorted out and verified with chemical analysis, sample preparation for smaller microplastic analysis is usually more difficult. Of the analytical approaches proposed in the literature, some are established, whereas others are a proof of principle and have not yet been applied to environmental samples. For the sake of development, all approaches are discussed and assessed for their potential applicability for soil samples. So far, none of the published methods seems ideally suitable for the analysis of smaller microplastics in soil samples, but slight modifications and combinations of methods may prove promising and need to be explored.},

  abstract = {Sample preparation for extraction of nanoscale plastic debris (NPD, size {$<$} 1 μm) from environmental samples is a critical step to prepare NPD for further identification and quantification. Developing a NPD extraction method from soil matrices is particularly challenging due to the complexity of solid matrices. In the present study, we built upon the lessons learned from method development for extraction of microplastics and nanomaterials from environmental samples to develop a sample preparation method for extraction of NPD from soil matrices. The evaluation criteria for the extraction method are size distribution, particle number recovery, and particle mass recovery. Since there is no validated method available to trace and quantify the mass of NPD in complex matrices, we applied polystyrene particles doped with europium (Eu-PS NPs). Standard LUFA soil and field soil were spiked and mixed for 24 h with 1 mg of Eu-PS NPs and the particles were extracted from the matrices of the soils. The extraction method did not significantly influence the size distribution of the particles and the extraction agents did not degrade the Eu-PS NPs. Mass balance calculation suggested recoveries of 82 and 77\% of the added Eu-PS NPs in LUFA soil and field soil, respectively. The number recoveries of the particles were 81 and 85\% for LUFA soil and field soil, respectively. This method can be further optimized and used as the first building block to develop a generic sample preparation method for the extraction of NPD from soil samples. By combining this developed and verified extraction method with identification and quantification techniques, a fit-for-purpose workflow can be developed to quantify and subsequently understand the fate of NPD in soil.},

Results from West Virginia indicated that shredded (7.6 cm) and chopped (7.6 cm) newspaper conserved moisture similar to higher application rates of the shredded material. Higher newspaper mulching rates reduced soil temperature compared to black plastic and bare ground. Chopped newspaper controlled weeds more consistently than other treatments. At least 7.6 cm of chopped newspaper mulch was required to control weeds at least 90\%. Wheat straw was not as effective in controlling weeds as 7.6 cm or greater of newspaper mulch. Chopped newspaper provided higher tomato yields than shredded newspaper applied at the same rates. Mulches applied at 0, 2, or 4 WAT resulted in weed control similar to the chemical treatment. In North Carolina, mulches applied 2 or 4 WAT resulted in tomato yields similar to the chemical treatment. Shredded and chopped newspaper have potential as a mulching material but may vary in effect in different environments and vegetable crops.},

Disintegration of plastic products due to mainly biochemical or physical activities leads to the formation and existence of microplastics in significant amounts, not only in marine and freshwater environments but also in soils. There are several valuable studies on microplastics in soils, which have typically focused on environmental, chemical, agricultural and health aspects. However, there is also a need for the geotechnical engineering perspective on microplastic contamination in soils. In this review paper, first, degradation, existence and persistence of microplastics in soils are assessed by considering various studies. Then, the potential role of solid waste disposal facilities as a source for microplastics is discussed by considering their geotechnical design and addressing the risk for the migration of microplastics from landfills to soils and other environments. Even though landfills are considered as one of the main geotechnical structures that contribute to the formation of considerably high amounts of microplastics and their contamination in soils, some other geotechnical engineering applications (i.e., soil improvement with tirechips, forming engineering fills with dredged sediments, soil improvement with synthetic polymer-based fibers, polystyrene based lightweight fill applications), as potential local source for microplastics, are also mentioned. Finally, the importance of geotechnical engineering as a mitigation tool for microplastics is emphasized and several important research topics involving geotechnical engineering are suggested.},

  abstract = {Gas exchange and growth of woody landscape plants is strongly affected by underlying surfaces. In urban areas, plants are subjected to energy balance characteristics of a variety of surfaces. We investigated energy balance properties of six urban surfaces: asphalt, gravel rock mulch, lava rock mulch, concrete, pine bark mulch, and turf. Each summer over a 3-year period, incoming global shortwave radiation, surface temperature, surface reflectivity (albedo), soil temperature below each surface, and soil heat flux were measured for each surface, and total incoming radiation, thermal conductivity, and longwave radiation emitted by each surface were calculated. Differences in surface properties were analyzed by regression analysis. Albedo was greatest for concrete and least for lava rock mulch, while thermal conductivity was greatest for asphalt and least for lava rock and pine bark mulches. Under maximum incoming total radiation, regression analysis indicated: soil heat flux was greatest under asphalt and concrete and least under lava rock and pine bark mulches; soil temperature below each surface was greatest for asphalt and concrete and least for pine bark mulch; surface temperature was greatest for pine bark mulch and least for turf; and longwave radiation flux of each surface was greatest for pine bark mulch and least for turf. This research revealed that more energy was conducted into the soil below asphalt and concrete, and that a greater portion of incoming radiation was prevented from entering the soil below pine bark and lava rock mulches than below other surfaces. Due to these effects, and the lack of evaporative cooling, surface temperatures were greater, and more longwave radiation was emitted from non-vegetative surfaces than from turf. In a concurrent study, we investigated if the energy balance of turf, pine bark mulch, and asphalt surfaces influenced gas exchange of four containerized tree species grown over each surface. On several occasions over a 2-year period, morning-to-evening measurements of stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, and plant water loss were made on containerized Bechtel crabapple (Malus ionensis ‘Plena’), Norway maple (Acer platanoides ‘Crimson King’), globe willow (Salix matsudana ‘Navajo’) and American plane tree (Platanus occidentalis). Leaves over pine bark mulch and asphalt intercepted more longwave radiation and generally had greater leaf temperature and leaf-to-air vapor difference than leaves over turf. As a result, trees over non-vegetative surfaces generally had lower stomatal conductance and water loss than trees over turf.},

The quantification of these contaminants is highly relevant for the evaluation of anthropogenic impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and dependent of the efficacy of methods to separate microplastics from environmental matrices. Little information is available about the microplastic extraction methods on complex samples – i.e. samples with multiple types of matrices. Herein, methods for the separation of microplastics from complex samples are summarized and discussed based on their advantages and drawbacks focused on a comparative analysis of their efficiency on organic matter removal, polymer recovery and preservation of plastic integrity. The efficiency on microplastic recovery and organic matter reduction, as well as the examination of the effects of treatments on plastics are closely linked to the density and digestion approaches selected, the polymer features and the environmental matrix analyzed. High-density salt solutions are more effective for density separation, while oxidative methods have recurrently shown better rates of organic matter reduction (particularly in vegetal-rich samples) and plastic recovery, with little impact on plastics, while 10 \% KOH has been described as highly efficient in samples containing animal organic matter. This comparative analysis highlights the benefits and limitations of different approaches for the analysis of microplastics in complex samples which may be helpful for the optimization and harmonization of the methods.},

The use of mulching reduced the soil moisture variability throughout the crop cycle and allowed a greater distribution of soil water that was more intense in the clay soil. The clayey soil provided on average 43 mm more water depth retention in 0.50 m soil deep relative to the sandy loam soil, and reduced 5.6 mm the crop cycle soil moisture variation compared to sandy loam soil.},

A lot of work has been done on the concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides in chemical fertilizers, but little work has focused on the occurrence of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). In this study the occurrence of 43 SVOCs listed as priority pollutants in 22 widely used-fertilizers of China was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Twenty-six SVOCs were detected with different detection frequencies and concentrations. The most abundant compounds were phthalic acid esters (PAEs; ranging from 1.17 to 2795 μg kg−1 dry weight, d.w.) and nitroaromatics (up to 9765 μg kg−1 d.w.), followed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; \&lt;140 μg kg−1 d.w.) and halogenated hydrocarbons (\&lt;900 μg kg−1 d.w.). Chlorobenzenes and haloethers occurred generally at low concentrations. There are large variations in concentrations of various compounds in different fertilizers, and the total concentrations of each class of contaminants varied widely, too. The highest levels of sum concentration for 16 PAHs, for 6 PAEs and for nitroaromatics were found in organic fertilizer containing pesticide and soil amendments. Concentrations of SVOCs in coated fertilizers (the controlled release fertilizer with coating) were considerably higher than those in the corresponding fertilizers without coating.

  abstract = {Accumulation of heavy metals from agricultural soils contaminated by low levels heavy metals has important implications in the understanding of heavy metal contamination in the food chain. Through field experiments (1994-1996), the influence of thermal regime under different treatments on the accumulation of zinc, cadmium, copper, and lead in Chinese cabbage [Brassica pekinensis (Lour) Rupr. cv. Nagaoka 50] grown in a Calcareous Fluvisol (Xerofluvent) in Granada (southern Spain) was examined. Two floating row covers were used: T-1 (perforated polyethylene, 50 mum thick) and T-2 (17 g m(-2) polypropylene nonwoven fleece). An uncovered cultivation (T-0) served as control. Zn, Cd, Cu, and Pb levels in the whole tops of experimental plants were analyzed. Treatments T-1 and T-2 gave rise to differences in environmental conditions with respect to T-0. The influence of environmental factors manipulated by floating row covers (particularly under T-1) increased total heavy metal accumulation in the aboveground plant biomass with respect to the open-air crop. The total contents of Zn, Cd, Cu, and Pb were 30, 50, 90, and 40\% higher in T-1, respectively, than in T-0. This technique could be used in contaminated zones for different plant species because the thermal effect favors the process of phytoextraction and thus reduces the contamination.},

  abstract = {The use of plastic materials for mulching is a very common practice for vegetable crops. Black polyethylene is the most widely used due to its excellent properties and low cost. However, the massive use of these materials supposes an environmental risk. In the last few years, the use of starch-based biodegradable films has been introduced as an alternative to conventional mulches. These materials can be incorporated into the soil at the end of the crop season and undergo biodegradation by soil microorganisms. A 2-year study was conducted to determine the response of a tomato crop to seven mulch materials (polyethylene and biodegradable) in open fields in Central Spain. Biodegradable films underwent early decomposition, but in general remained functional during use and did not affect yield and the fruit quality attributes (total soluble solids, firmness, dry weight, juice content and shape). The temperatures reached under polyethylene films were always higher than under biodegradable films, which could be a disadvantage in certain circumstances, especially in hot climates, although may be advantageous in cool conditions. The use of polyethylene films resulted in the lowest values of soil microbial biomass C and soil organic matter mineralization, probably due to the increase of temperature registered under mulches. The analysis of the marketable yield components indicates that the variability in yield mainly depended on the number of fruits, with mean fruit weight being practically constant in the different treatments and seasons, which suggests the strong varietal character of this parameter.

In this situation, heavy metals and trace elements from these polluted soils may accumulate in the agricultural plants being grown in them and thereby enter the human food chain. The objectives of this study are to elucidate the effects of growth conditions, manipulated by the crop covers, on the phytoaccumulation of elements, and to investigate the conceivable influences of these conditions on the plant biochemistry. In three consecutive years of field experiments, open air (T0), and floating rowcover treatments (T1: perforated polyethylene 50 μm; T2: polypropylene 17 g m−2) were used to produce different environmental conditions for the growth of Chinese cabbage [Brassica rapa L. (Pekinensis group) cv. ‘Nagaoka 50’]. Five samplings (whole tops) were carried out from transplanting to harvest and measurements of B, Al, Ag, Si and Ca concentration as well as phenolics (orto-diphenols, total phenols and anthocyanins), pectic fractions, amino acids (histidine, phenylalanine and tyrosine) and polyphenol oxidase activity, were carried out in samples. The T1 (perforated polyethylene sheet) gave greater B, Al, Ag and Si concentration and phytoextraction (in weight units) than the open-air control. These findings can help to develop new cost-effective techniques for phytoremediation as the application of plastic covers in the field. The build-up of heavy metals in those crops would make the product less suitable for human consumption.},

In the last decades, agricultural films gained not only a great deal of interest and attention but also a big market more and more extended in any country of Europe, America, and Asia, with a constant positive trend that does not know crisis. Plasticulture is a term that indicates the world of plastic films applied in agriculture, ranging from greenhouse covers to mulches, from low tunnels to solarization films, from Totally Impermeable Films (TIF) to photo-selective films. It includes raw material (several kinds of polymers), different types of films, applications, agronomical performances, and the recycling problems. In this chapter, a review of Plasticulture is presented, from historical origins to the films extrusion technique, from their physical properties to the different typologies and uses. In particular, a new generation of agricultural films is described with characteristics, performances, and employment modalities. Finally, the new frontier of plastic films for greenhouse, with open window to UV-B radiation, is presented, considering the huge potentiality for improving further the crops quality and the increase of different nutraceutical contents in fruits and vegetables.},

Plastic mulch has been evaluated as an alternative technology on experimental stations in the Southeast but its use has not yet gained wide acceptance among limited resource vegetable producers in the area. In this study, the economic feasibility of plastic mulch was evaluated as a profit enhancing technology for limited resource farmers. A farmer survey and farm simulation model were used in the evaluation of this technology. It was noted in the survey that most of the farmers in the research area were part-time and were above 50 years old. The average age was 60, with a minimum of 29 and maximum of 88. Plastic mulch resulted in increased output and farm revenue. The capital turnover ratio for production with plastic mulch was higher than for production without plastic mulch. Each hour of labor used with plastic mulch generated six times more net revenues than without plastic mulch. The total investment required for plastic mulch more than doubled, indicating that it might be difficult to encourage this age group of farmers to adopt the technology without easy credit arrangements. The diffusion of this technology may be difficult unless the alternative of renting vs. buying the necessary equipment is presented to this age group of farmers.},

Changes in material properties due to aging were recorded using appropriate polymer characterization methods, such as differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and microscopy. Pellets were exposed to water containing BTEX and the ethers at 130–190 μg L−1 for up to two weeks. Aqueous sorbate concentrations were determined by headspace gas chromatography. Sorption to the polymers was correlated with the sorbate's Kow and was significant for BTEX and marginal for the ethers. Due to substantially lower glass transition temperatures, PP showed higher sorption than PS. Aging had no effect on the sorption behavior of PP. PS sorbed less BTEX after aging due to an oxidized surface layer.},

Although it was shown that the comparability between previously published studies is highly limited, there are ambitious efforts regarding the standardization of microplastic analysis. This comparative study serves as a first step to assess the suitability of frequently used methods in microplastic research. Furthermore, it highlights obstacles when conducting a comparative study for microplastics. Results from 17 laboratories from eight different countries are compared. Samples comprised of five different types of microplastic reference particles with diameters ranging from 8 µm to 140~μm suspended in ultrapure water. Microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (μ-FTIR), Raman microspectroscopy (μ-Raman), thermo-extraction-and-desorption- or pyrolysis- combined with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (Σ-GC/MS), scanning electron microscopy and particle counter were compared regarding results on total particle number, polymer type, number of particles and/or particle mass for each polymer type. In the scope of this comparative study, for the identification of polymer type μ-Raman and Σ-GC/MS performed best. The quantification of polymer mass for identified polymer types was questionable for Σ-GC/MS, whereas other methods failed to determine the correct polymer mass. Quantification of particle number per identified polymer type was evaluated successful for μ-FTIR and the quantification of total particle numbers was best for microscopy and to a lesser extent for μ-FTIR. Remarkable was the large variance of results between the methods but also within the methods. The latter is likely due to individual interpretations of methods and preparation protocols, in particular in regard to the handling of blank values. Results strongly emphasize the need for standardization and validation of analytical methods in microplastic research both on a global scale as well as in the context of individual laboratories.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of PM on mycotoxin occurrence in relation with mycobiome abundance/diversity and soil physicochemical properties. Soil samples were collected from green (GA) and white asparagus (WA) crops, the last under PM. Both crops were cultivated in a ridge–furrow–ridge system without irrigation. Samples were analyzed for mycotoxin occurrence via liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Total colony-forming unit was indicative of mycobiome abundance, and analysis of mycobiome diversity was performed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing. PM avoided the drop of soil temperature in winter and allowed higher soil temperature in early spring compared to non-covered soil. Moreover, the use of PM provided controlled conditions for water content in soil. This was enough to generate a dissimilar mycotoxin occurrence and mycobiome diversity/abundance in covered and non-covered soil. Mycotoxin soil contamination was confirmed for deoxynivalenol (DON), range LOD to 32.1 ng/g (LOD = 1.1 ng/g). The DON values were higher under PM (average 16.9 ± 10.1 ng/g) than in non-covered soil (9.1 ± 7.9 ng/g); however, this difference was not statically significant (p = 0.09). Mycobiome analysis showed a fungal compartment up to fivefold higher in soil under PM compared to GA. The diversity of the mycobiome varied between crops and also along the soil column, with an important dominance of Fusarium species at the root zone in covered soils.},

Soil samples were collected from strawberry crops used during 4 years as mono-cropping system, covered by either straw or black polyethylene (plastic mulching). Soil physicochemical properties included water content, pH, effective cation exchange capacity, elemental analysis of total carbon and nitrogen, dissolved and total organic carbon, and soil stability by percentage of water-stable aggregates (\&gt;0.2 mm). Soil microbial analysis comprised soil microbial biomass (Cmic and Nmic and DNA concentrations) and estimation of soil eco-physiological conditions Cmic:Corg and Nmic:Ntot. Soil bacteria and a fraction of cultivable fungi were studied respectively by molecular analysis and counting of colony-forming units (CFU values). Mycotoxin concentration in soil (deoxynivalenol) was used as an indirect indicator of fungal stress. The plastic mulching system showed positive effects on soil physicochemical properties as compared to straw mulching: Higher soil carbon content and better aggregate stability were observed in soils under plastic film, and the values for soil microbial biomass were comparable in both systems. Yet, soil eco-physiological conditions under plastic mulching were less appropriate compared to straw, as reflected by a reduced Cmic:Corg ratio (1.3 ± 0.3\%), followed by a decline of the number of bacteria (18\%), a six-fold reduction of the biomass of soil cultivable fungi, and finally by a two-times higher deoxynivalenol concentration in soil (mean 2.2 ± 2.4 μg kg−1). This indicates that the plastic mulching system led to less favourable soil conditions and that the production of mycotoxins can be understood as a stress induced response by fungi. Further information is therefore needed to assess how the quality of soil is restricted by the shift of soil microbial communities and by the production of mycotoxins, especially in intensive agriculture with long-term plastic coverage.},

In addition to the primary concern of MP levels in the environment, they have also been known to sorb a variety of organic materials, concentrating and transporting them into the environment and aquatic life. The focus of this study was to evaluate differences in surface characteristics and chemical composition of neat MP standards relative to MP samples extracted from personal care products and wastewater effluent. MPs were first chemically characterized using Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to determine their composition, then physically characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Profilometry (OP). Under SEM and OP imaging, neat polyethylene MP standards appeared uniform in spherical shape with a smooth surface displaying shallow pitting. MPs extracted from personal care products were characterized as polyethylene and many of these samples displayed a significant distortion from the spherical shape of the neat standards with crevices ranging at various depths. MPs extracted from a Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) effluent tank were characterized as polyethylene and other unidentified plastic polymers. Through SEM and OP, the WWTP effluent extracted MPs were seen to have similar surface characteristics to the personal care product extracted spherical MPs, demonstrating deep pits and large flat top peaks. OP was used to quantitatively compare the MPs by three surface roughness parameters. This proof-of-concept study is the first to utilize FT-IR, SEM and OP for the surface characterization of MP samples. Combining these three methods allows for the chemical identification of MPs along with the qualitative and quantitative comparison of their surface characteristics, demonstrating that MPs extracted from personal care products and WWTP effluent differ greatly from neat microsphere standards of similar sizes.},

  abstract = {Removing non-plastic materials is a mandatory process for studying microplastics in environmental samples, and non-plastic materials, both inorganic and organic matter, are often removed chemically through sequential processes. In the multiple chemical treatment processes, the samples need to be collected and the reagent removed at the end of each chemical treatment before the samples are again exposed to a different reagent in a separate container. This leads to a loss of microplastics to some extent. Here, we developed a new, yet simple, small sieve made of stainless-steel that can fit in a laboratory beaker (e.g. 200\,ml volume), allowing it to be transferred as-is between chemical treatments of environmental samples, even being soakable in a beaker of acid solution. The collection rates of microplastics were significantly higher in the small stainless-steel sieve than the commonly used filter method for different size of microplastic particles. The use of the new sieve means the processes of rinsing off and filtering samples can be abbreviated throughout the entire process of non-plastic matter removal from environmental samples, contributing to a lower chance of microplastic loss. The time consumed in the sieve method was also significantly lower than for the filtering method due to the elimination of the collection and rinsing steps, thus the use of this sieve can reduce processing time for the samples. The new method is innovative in terms of reducing both the microplastic loss and processing time during chemical treatment processes. •The method developed allows the lower chance of microplastic loss during chemical digestion process•The method reduces the time of sequential processes during chemical digestion},

  abstract = {Increasing fossil fuel prices and the demand for clean energy have accelerated research on renewable energy sources. Pyrolysis oil (also known as bio-oil) which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass by a fast pyrolysis process has the potential to substitute for petroleum-derived transportation fuels. However, pyrolysis oil has lower energy density (15-19 MJ/kg), compared with petroleum (40 MJ/kg) due to the high oxygen content (30-60 wt \%). Furthermore, pyrolysis oil is thermally unstable that tends to age and results in phase separation at room temperature. Therefore, upgrading of pyrolysis oil is necessary before it can be used as a transportation fuel.        Hydrotreating is an effective option to upgrade pyrolysis oil to generate hydrocarbons. However, the conventional process requires elevated temperatures and pressure of H2 to ensure a high level of deoxygenation. At high temperatures, coke formation by polymerization of hydroxyphenols or methoxyphenols in pyrolysis oil has been observed as the main factor affecting the stability of the catalysts. In addition, catalytic upgrading under a high temperature increased the carbon loss to CO2 and CH4. Thus, a more economical method is needed.       Our efforts to carry out hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) at relatively mild conditions to produce alcohols and hydrocarbon fuels over various supported catalysts are reported here. Different solvents have been tried to ease the problems of high viscosity and thermal instability of pyrolysis oil, clogging of reactors, considerable coking, and catalyst deactivation.  The highest gas yield of HDO of pyrolysis oil was 21.1 NL/kg and the gas phase generated during upgrading had 70-85\% CO2, which indicated that the oxygen in the pyrolysis oil was successfully removed. Acetic acid content decreased from 3.85 wt\% to below 0.01 wt\% after HDO. FT-IR data reveals that alcohols tend to be produced at lower temperatures and alkene C=C stretching vibration was found in the IR data of the upgraded pyrolysis oil showing that hydrocarbons were produced during HDO. The main products included up to 16.1\% alcohols, 3.8\% cyclic compounds, 21.2\% hydrocarbons and 35.7\% phenolics. Alcohols production can be used as gasoline additive to increase its octane number. Hydrocarbons production mainly contained C15-C16 hydrocarbons that fall in diesel carbon range. Our results successfully demonstrate a potential method for upgrading pyrolysis oil into transportation fuel under mild conditions.},

Here, we aimed at outlining the status of Raman analysis of microplastics from aquatic systems, highlighting the advantages and the drawbacks of this technique and critically presenting tools and ways to effectively employ this instrument and to improve the spectra obtained and their interpretation. In particular, we summarized procedural information for the use of Raman spectroscopy, and we discussed issues linked to fluorescence interference and the analysis of weathered polymers, which may complicate the interpretation of Raman signatures. In this context, a deep understanding of the different plastic polymers and their Raman peaks and chemical fingerprints is fundamental to avoid misidentification. Therefore, we provided a catalog with detailed information about peaks of most common plastic polymers, and this represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive resource that systematically synthesized plastic Raman peaks. Additionally, we focused on plastic additives, which are contained in the majority of plastics. These compounds are often intense in Raman scattering and may partly or completely overlie the actual material types, resulting in the identification of additives alone or misidentification issue. For these reasons, we also presented a new R package “RamanMP” that includes a database of 356 spectra (325 of which are additives). This will help to foster the use of this technique, which is becoming especially relevant in microplastic analysis.},

Sediment treatments varying in grain size were inoculated with known quantities of low-density polyethylene microbeads extracted from commercially bought facial scrubs. These microbeads varied in colour and size. Once extracted using a density separation method microbeads were counted. An overall underestimation of 78.59\% may be a result of observer error and/or technical error. More specifically, the results suggested that microbeads varying in colour and size have a different detection probability and that these microbead features are more important in underestimation likelihoods than grain sizes.},

  abstract = {Beyond simple identification of either the presence or absence of microplastic particles in the environment, quantitative accuracy has been criticised as being neither comparable nor reproducible. This is, in part, due to difficulties in the identification of synthetic particles amidst naturally occurring organic and inorganic components. The fluorescent stain Nile red has been proposed as a tool to overcome this issue, but to date, has been used without consideration of polymer specific fluorescent variability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Nile red for microplastic detection by systematically investigating what drives variations in particle pixel brightness (PPB). The results showed that PPB varied between polymer type, shape, size, colour and by staining procedure. Sand, an inorganic component of the sample matrix does not fluoresce when stained with Nile red. In contrast the organic components, wood and chitin, fluoresce between 1.40 and 12 arbitrary units (a.u.) and 32 and 74 a.u. after Nile red staining, respectively. These data informed the use of a PPB threshold limit of 100 a.u., which improved the detection of EPS, HDPE, PP and PA-6 from the 6 polymers tested and reduced analysis time by 30–58\% compared to unstained samples. Conversely, as with traditional illumination, PET and PVC were not accurately estimated using this approach. This study shows that picking a threshold limit is not arbitrary but rather must be informed by polymer specific fluorescent variability and matrix considerations. This is an essential step needed to facilitate comparability and reproducibility between individual studies.},

  abstract = {Soil biodegradable mulch films composed of the polyester polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) are being increasingly used in agriculture. Analytical methods to quantify PBAT in field soils are needed to assess its soil occurrence and fate. Here, we report an analytical method for PBAT in soils that couples Soxhlet extraction or accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with quantitative protonnuclear magnetic resonance (q-1H NMR) spectroscopy detection. The 1H NMR peak areas of aromatic PBAT protons increased linearly with PBAT concentrations dissolved in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), demonstrating accurate quantitation of PBAT by q-1H NMR. Spike-recovery experiments involving PBAT addition to model sorbents and soils showed increased PBAT extraction efficiencies into chloroform (CHCl3) with methanol (MeOH) as cosolvent, consistent with MeOH competitively displacing PBAT from H-bond donating sites on mineral surfaces. Systematic variations in solvent composition and temperatures in ASE revealed quantitative PBAT extraction from soil with 90/10 volume \% CHCl3/MeOH at 110–120 °C. Both Soxhlet extraction and ASE resulted in the complete recovery of PBAT added to a total of seven agricultural soils covering a range of physicochemical properties, independent of whether PBAT was added to soils dissolved in CHCl3, as film, or as particles. Recovery was also complete for PBAT added to soil in the form of a commercial soil biodegradable mulch film with coextractable polylactic acid (PLA). The presented analytical method enables accurate quantification and biodegradation monitoring of PBAT in agricultural field soils.},

The polyethylene mulches were black, gray, infrared transmitting brown (IRT-brown), IRT-green, white, and white-on-black (co-extruded white/black). On average, 1\%, 2\%, 17\%, 26\%, 42\%, and 45\% light in the 400 to 1100 nm range was transmitted through the black, white/black, gray, IRT-brown, IRT-green, and white mulches, respectively. In field experiments, density and dry biomass of weeds growing under the mulches were evaluated. The white mulch had the highest weed density with an average of 39.6 and 155.9 plants/m2 in 2001 and 2002, respectively. This was followed by the gray mulch, with 10.4 and 44.1 weed seedlings/m2 in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Weed density was {$<$}25 plants/m2 with the other mulches in both years. Weed infestation was correlated with average light transmission for white, black, white/black, and gray mulches. However, both light quantity and quality were necessary to predict weed infestations with the IRT mulches. Weed infestation under the IRT mulches was better estimated when only wave lengths in the photosynthetically active radiation range (PAR; 400 to 700 nm) were considered. Low weed pressure and high light transmission with the IRT mulches would make them appropriate for use in areas where both weed control and soil warming are important factors.},

They are small enough to be ingested by a wide range of organisms and at nano-scale, they may cross some biological barriers. However, our understanding of their ecological impact on the terrestrial environment is limited. Plastic particle loading in agroecosystems could be high due to inputs of some recycled organic waste and plastic film mulching, so it is vital that we develop a greater understanding of any potentially harmful or adverse impacts of these pollutants to agroecosystems. In this article, we discuss the sources of plastic particles in agroecosystems, the mechanisms, constraints and dynamic behaviour of plastic during aging on land, and explore the responses of soil organisms and plants at different levels of biological organisation to plastic particles of micro and nano-scale. Based on limited evidence at this point and understanding that the lack of evidence of ecological impact from microplastic and nanoplastic in agroecosystems does not equate to the evidence of absence, we propose considerations for addressing the gaps in knowledge so that we can adequately safeguard world food supply.},

  abstract = {ConspectusThe vast amount of plastic waste emitted into the environment and the increasing concern of potential harm to wildlife has made microplastic and nanoplastic pollution a growing environmental concern. Plastic pollution has the potential to cause both physical and chemical harm to wildlife directly or via sorption, concentration, and transfer of other environmental contaminants to the wildlife that ingest plastic. Small particles of plastic pollution, termed microplastics ({$>$}100 nm and {$<$}5 mm) or nanoplastics ({$<$}100 nm), can form through fragmentation of larger pieces of plastic. These small particles are especially concerning because of their high specific surface area for sorption of contaminants as well as their potential to translocate in the bodies of organisms. These same small particles are challenging to separate and identify in environmental samples because their size makes handling and observation difficult. As a result, our understanding of the environmental prevalence of nanoplastics and microplastics is limited.Generally, the smaller the size of the plastic particle, the more difficult it is to separate from environmental samples. Currently employed passive density and size separation techniques to isolate plastics from environmental samples are not well suited to separate microplastics and nanoplastics. Passive flotation is hindered by the low buoyancy of small particles as well as the difficulty of handling small particles on the surface of flotation media. Here we suggest exploring alternative techniques borrowed from other fields of research to improve separation of the smallest plastic particles. These techniques include adapting active density separation (centrifugation) from cell biology and taking advantage of surface-interaction-based separations from analytical chemistry.Furthermore, plastic pollution is often challenging to quantify in complex matrices such as biological tissues and wastewater. Biological and wastewater samples are important matrices that represent key points in the fate and sources of plastic pollution, respectively. In both kinds of samples, protocols need to be optimized to increase throughput, reduce contamination potential, and avoid destruction of plastics during sample processing. To this end, we recommend adapting digestion protocols to match the expected composition of the nonplastic material as well as taking measures to reduce and account for contamination.Once separated, plastics in an environmental sample should ideally be characterized both visually and chemically. With existing techniques, microplastics and nanoplastics are difficult to characterize or even detect. Their low mass and small size provide limited signal for visual, vibrational spectroscopic, and mass spectrometric analyses. Each of these techniques involves trade-offs in throughput, spatial resolution, and sensitivity. To accurately identify and completely quantify microplastics and nanoplastics in environmental samples, multiple analytical techniques applied in tandem are likely to be required.},

  abstract = {Soil solarization practice, in which soil is covered with plastic mulch film and exposed to high temperature prior to crop cultivation, is expected to be an effective method for reducing weeds and pathogenic microorganisms without using agricultural chemicals. Although the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas, is enhanced in fertilized soil covered with plastic mulch films, its transport route to the atmosphere has not been sufficiently elucidated to date. In this study, we investigated the N2O evolution from plastic-mulch-film-covered agricultural soil. In a horticultural field where ridge soil was covered with a plastic mulch film after fertilization, we observed significant N2O flux from the soil surface of the unfertilized furrow between the ridges, indicating the horizontal diffusion of N2O from the ridge soil covered with the mulch film to the adjacent furrow soil surface. On the other hand, the measurement of the permeance (permeation coefficient) of the plastic mulch film for gaseous N2O by laboratory experiment revealed that N2O gradually permeated the mulch film; the permeance increased exponentially with an increase in ambient temperature, indicating possible N2O emission by permeation through the mulch film under field conditions. In winter, the amount of N2O emission by permeation through the mulch film was estimated to be lower than that emitted from the furrow soil surface, and it was lower than that in summer. On the other hand, it was estimated to be much higher in summer owing to the higher permeance of the film at high temperatures.},

First, 1 kg sediments was pre-extracted using the air-induced overflow (AIO) method, based on fluidisation in a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. The original sediment mass was reduced by up to 80\%. As a consequence, it was possible to reduce the volume of sodium iodide (NaI) solution used for the subsequent flotation step. Recoveries of the whole procedure for polyethylene, polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene and polyurethane with sizes of approximately 1 mm were between 91 and 99\%. After being stored for one week in a 35\% H2O2 solution, 92\% of selected biogenic material had dissolved completely or had lost its colour, whereas the tested polymers were resistant. Microplastics were extracted from three sediment samples collected from the North Sea island Norderney. Using pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, these microplastics were identified as PP, PVC and PET. Ó 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, MP vertical mobility in the subsurface remains uncertain due to a lack of scientific data. This study focused on MP penetration in sand soil column experiments. Here we report the mobility of five different MPs, which consisted of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) particles of various sizes and densities. We observed that the smallest sized PE MPs (21 μm) had the greatest movement potential. Moreover, it was found that when these MPs were subjected to greater numbers of wet-dry cycles, the penetration depth significantly increased, with an apparent linear relationship between depth and wet-dry cycle number (r2 = 0.817). In comparison, increasing the volume of infiltration liquid or the surface MP concentration had only negligible or weak effects on migration depth (r2 = 0.169 and 0.312, respectively). Based on the observed wet-dry cycle trend, we forecast 100-year penetration depths using weather data for 347 cities across China. The average penetration depth was calculated as 5.24 m (95\% CI = 2.78–7.70 m), with Beijing Municipality and Hebei, Henan and Hubei provinces being the most vulnerable to MP vertical dispersion. Our results suggest that soils may not only represent a sink for MPs, but also a feasible entryway to subsurface receptors, such as subterranean fauna or aquifers. Finally, research gaps are identified and suggested research directions are put forward to garner a better understanding MP vertical migration in soil.},

Research is necessary to understand the interactions between marine microbial communities and microplastics, and to explore the potential for microplastics to serve as transport systems for pathogenic microorganisms. Our review summarises first insights into these topics and discusses gaps in our current knowledge. Abstract The accumulation of plastic in the marine environment is a long-known issue, but the potential relevance of this pollution for the ocean has been recognised only recently. Within this context, microplastic fragments ({$<$}5mm) represent an emerging topic. Owing to their small size, they are readily ingested by marine wildlife and can accumulate in the food web, along with associated toxins and microorganisms colonising the plastic. We are starting to understand that plastic biofilms are diverse and are, comparably with non-plastic biofilms, driven by a complex network of influences, mainly spatial and seasonal factors, but also polymer type, texture and size of the substratum. Within this context, we should raise the question about the potential of plastic particles to serve as vectors for harmful microorganisms. The main focus of the review is the discussion of first insights and research gaps related to microplastic-associated microbial biofilm communities.},

The microscope FT-IR analysis showed CC double bonds (1640cm−1) around the surface of the whitened part. Significant levels of hydroperoxide and hydroxide absorption bands were also observed. Optical microscope observations of films stained with lactophenol cotton blue revealed that the bioactivity of the film surface was especially high in the vicinity of small holes. Several colonies of microbes were observed by optical microscope with cotton blue staining as well as by SEM. We concluded that the biodegradation of thin LDPE film in soil was unexpectedly fast because of the synergistic action of oxidative and/or photo-oxidative degradation on biological activity, which is probably due to the increasing hydrophilicity of the film surface.}

Quite large amounts of hybrid dimers of styrene and styrene-d8 units were formed as well as the homo-dimers of the two types of units in the block copolymer, whereas formation of hybrid trimers was negligible. The principal hybrid dimers were CD2C(C6D5)CD2CH2(C6H5) and CH2C(C6H5)CH2CD2(C6D5), and their yields were comparable with those of the homo-dimers. These results suggest that the dimers are primarily formed through the reactions of unsaturated chain-ends and benzyl radicals which are generated by 1,5-transfer of the secondary macroradical followed by β-scission. On the other hand, dimer formation through 1,3-transfer, as proposed by many authors, was confirmed not to be the main pathway to the dimers.},

Polymer recycling is being considered as one of the most widely accepted remedies to the threat of growing amounts of plastic waste by both the public and scientists. In practice, recycling is associated with many difficulties, such as problems related to separation, sorting and cleaning operations, lack of fiscal subsidies, instability of selective garbage separation programs, high transport and electricity costs, etc. Still, a large section of society and the authorities agree on the necessity and importance of recycling to protect the environment, and natural habitats and resources for future generations in a balanced manner to conserve raw materials, and to reduce energy consumption, municipal solid waste production and greenhouse gas emission. The recycling effort is almost endless in itself and includes a variety of approaches such as refurbishing, mechanically reshaping, chemically treating, thermally utilizing, etc. Some novel approaches such as application in carbon capture or synthesis of carbon nanostructures from the plastic waste are among the new process technologies of recycling.

  abstract = {Plastics accumulate in the natural environment due to their durability and low recycling volumes. Wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) have been identified as important sources for the release of plastics into aquatic and terrestrial environments that may lead to further contamination. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current knowledge on plastic pollution from WWTPs. Specifically, this article presents the current status on the sources of plastics entering WWTPs via influent, the occurrence of plastics in WWTP influent, treated effluent and sewage sludge as well as the techniques used for sampling and analysing plastics in WWTP derived samples. The fate and transfer of plastics from WWTPs to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is also discussed. While various studies have reported the presence of plastics in WWTP samples, which have certainly improved our level of understanding on the fate of plastics within the WWTP treatment chain, many unanswered questions still remain. A major gap is the lack of standardized methods and robust analytical techniques for the sampling, identification and quantification of plastics including nano-sized plastics in WWTP derived samples, leading to the potential underestimation of total plastics. To aid comparison of data generated by different researchers, we advocate for the harmonisation of sampling approaches, extraction methods, analytical techniques and reporting units for plastics abundance. Future studies should focus on enhanced methods that can also include estimates of nano-sized plastics.},

  abstract = {The presence of small plastic particles in the environment, reported for the first time in the 1970's, has only recently been recognized as a global issue. Although environmental awareness continues to grow, so does its consumption and associated risks. The number of studies reporting the presence of microplastics, has grown exponentially as did the concern over plastic degradation into smaller particles like nanoplastics, a potentially more pernicious form of plastic pollution. The reported effects of micro(nano)plastics on biota range from depletion of energy reserves and altered metabolism to immunological, neurotoxic effects and behavioral effects. This paper presents a critical review of current scientific knowledge in terms of reasons to study the effects of small plastics present in the environment, what has been assessed so far; most common methodologies. Research and technical developments requirements are also presented. Overall, it is clear the need for standardization of procedures and communication of results.},

Regardless of application method, VIF retained greater amounts of cis- and trans-1,3-D and CP in the root zone with longer residential time than PE. There was better retention of the three compounds in the root zone when applied with the Avenger coulter injection rig than chisel injection, especially in combination with VIF. Distribution of the three compounds in the root zone was less predictable when applied by drip irrigation. Following drip irrigation, more than 50\% of the three compounds in the PE and VIF-covered beds was found near the end of the drip tapes in one experiment, whereas the distribution was much more uniform in the root zone in a second experiment. Among the three biologically active compounds, CP disappeared from the root zone more rapidly than cis- and trans-1,3-D, especially in the PE-covered beds.},

  abstract = {Background, Aim and Scope At present, large-scale paper manufacture involves delignification and bleaching by elemental chlorine free (ECF) or totally chlorine free (TCF) processes. The wastewater is purified by secondary treatment (mechanical, chemical and biological) which removes most of the toxic substances from the discharge. However, we found residual toxicity in the high molecular ({$>$} 1000 D) matter (HMWM) of the discharge by test of the RET (reverse electronic transfer) inhibition. This fraction consists mainly of polydisperse lignin (LIG) and carbohydrate (CH) macromolecules. Structural units in these molecules are studied by pyrolysis gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS). In the present work, our aim was to find out those structural units which could explain the RET toxicity of LIG or CH molecules. We compared statistically RET toxicity values of the HMWM samples from treated wastewaters of pilot pulping experiments and intensity variation of the pyrolysis product gas chromatograms of these samples. This application is a novel study procedure. Methods Pyrolysis products (Py-GC/MS results) and inhibition of RET (reverse electronic transport toxicity) as TU50 and TU20 of HMWM (High Molecular Weight Material; Mw {$>$} 1000 D) were compared by multivariate statistics. The samples were from laboratory pilot stages of TCF (Totally Chlorine Free) and ECF (Elemental Chlorine Free) manufacture of softwood pulp. Py-GC/MS was done without and with addition of TMAH (Tetra Methyl Ammonium Hydroxide). The name and structure of each abundant fragment compound was identified from its retention time and mass spectrum compared to authentic reference compounds or literature. Four sets of Toxicity Units (TUs) and GC peak areas of the pyrolysis fragments were obtained. The data were normalized by division with LIG (lignin content of each sample). TU values were dependent and the fragment values independent (explanatory) variables in statistical treatments by SPSS system. Separate analyses of correlations, principal components (PCA) and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were performed from the four sample sets TCF and ECF with and without TMAH. Results and Discussion From the CH fragments, 2-furfural in TCF, and from the LIG fragments, styrene in ECF showed the highest probabilities to originate from source structures of toxicity. Other possible compounds in concern were indicated to be CH fragment 2-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one in ECF and LIG fragments 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methylphenol and 2-methylphenol in TCF.},

As these materials continue to accumulate in the environment, namely, in rivers and oceans, in the form of macro-, meso-, micro- and nanoplastics, it becomes of the utmost urgency to find new ways to curtail this environmental threat. Multiple efforts have been made to identify and isolate microorganisms capable of utilizing synthetic polymers and recent results point towards the viability of a solution for this problem based on the biodegradation of plastics resorting to selected microbial strains. Herein, the response of the fungus Zalerion maritimum to different times of exposition to polyethylene (PE) pellets, in a minimum growth medium, was evaluated, based on the quantified mass differences in both the fungus and the microplastic pellets used. Additionally, molecular changes were assessed through attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Results showed that, under the tested conditions, Z. maritimum is capable of utilizing PE, resulting in the decrease, in both mass and size, of the pellets. These results indicate that this naturally occurring fungus may actively contribute to the biodegradation of microplastics, requiring minimum nutrients.},

Microplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5~mm. Microplastics are ubiquitous and slowly-degrading contaminants in waters and soils. Microplastics have long residence time, high stability, high potential of being fragmented and can adsorb other contaminants. Many aquatic species contain microplastics, which are in particular~easily accumulated by planktonic and invertebrate organisms. Then, microplastics are transferred along food chains, leading to physical damages, decrease in nutritional diet value and exposure of the living organism to pathogens. Raw~plastics contain chemical additives such as phthalates, bisphenol A and polybrominated diphenyl ethers that may induce toxic effects after ingestion by living organisms. Furthermore, the adsorption capability of microplastics makes them prone to carry several contaminants. Methods to remove microplastics from water and other media are actually needed. Here, we review microplastics occurrence, transport, raw polymers and additives, toxicity and methods of removal. Removal methods include physical sorption and filtration, biological removal and ingestion, and chemical treatments. Mechanisms, efficiency, advantages, and drawbacks of various~removal methods are discussed.},

Atmospheric transport and tourism are major sources of MP pollution in mountain ecosystems. Snow samples provide the maximum concentration of MPs compared to that of stream or ice core samples. Precipitation events considerably influence MP deposition and fallout in mountains and glaciers. PE, PP, PS, polyester, and PVC are common plastic polymers with diverse shapes, such as fibers, fragments, films, and pellets. Ecological concerns and stress due to MP accumulated in natural ecosystems have also been discussed, with considerable focus on MP transport and distribution dynamics at higher altitudes as prospects for future research. A remarkable knowledge gap was observed regarding the MP pathways in the mountainous ecosystems and the assessment of microplastic-associated additives, such as heavy metals and other toxic chemicals, including the evidence of nano-sized plastics. Furthermore, studies on the ecological and biological risks posed by MPs on remote mountains is severely limited with respect to global climate change, biodiversity loss, and influence on ecosystem services.},

The TG/FTIR/QMS studies in inert atmosphere showed that the thermal decomposition of bio-polyamides takes place with the evolution of alkenes, nitriles, cyclic species and low molecular weight compounds - carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water and ammonia. The thermo-oxidative decomposition of bio-polyamides start with N-vicinal methylene group and follow with the scission of alkyl-amide or vicinal C-C bond. The high energy reactions result in production of mainly low molecular gases (CO2, CO, H2O, NH3). Char residue analysis revealed the presence of carboxylic end groups, which may participate in secondary reactions during degradation, resulting in crosslinks, and decomposing to carbon dioxide. Taking into account the thermoanalytical results obtained, the thermal decomposition pathway for bio-polyamides in inert atmosphere has been postulated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Determination of soil constituents and structure has a vital role in agriculture generally. Methods for the determination of soil carbon have in particular gained greater currency in recent times because of the potential that soils offer in providing offsets for greenhouse gas (CO\textbackslash textsubscript2-equivalent) emissions. Ideally, soil carbon which can also be quite diverse in its makeup and origin, should be measureable by readily accessible, affordable and reliable means. Loss-on-ignition is still a widely used method being suitably simple and available but may have limitations for soil C monitoring. How can these limitations be better defined and understood where such a method is required to detect relatively small changes during soil-C building? Thermogravimetric (TGA) instrumentation to measure carbonaceous components has become more interesting because of its potential to separate carbon and other components using very precise and variable heating programs. TGA related studies were undertaken to assist our understanding in the quantification of soil carbon when using methods such as loss-on-ignition. Combining instrumentation so that mass changes can be monitored by mass spectrometer ion currents has elucidated otherwise hidden features of thermal methods enabling the interpretation and evaluation of mass-loss patterns. Soil thermogravimetric work has indicated that loss-on-ignition methods are best constrained to temperatures from 200 to 430 °C for reliable determination for soil organic carbon especially where clay content is higher. In the absence of C-specific detection where mass only changes are relied upon, exceeding this temperature incurs increasing contributions from inorganic sources adding to mass losses with diminishing contributions related to organic matter. The smaller amounts of probably more recalcitrant organic matter released at the higher temperatures may represent mineral associated material and/or simply more refractory forms.},

  abstract = {Intensive vegetable cropping systems use large amounts of water and nutrients. Excess application of water and nutrients results in economic losses (higher fertilizers and pumping costs) and contributes to nutrient leaching and environmental degradation. Increasing nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) should be a priority for sustainable horticulture. This increased NUE, WUE, or both depend on the utilization of efficient irrigation technology, including appropriate methods for irrigation scheduling (IS).Various methods are available for IS based on determination of crop water balance (weather-based method), soil/substrate moisture level, or plant water relations. Rather than discussing the physical and biological basis of irrigation management, this article focuses on currently available irrigation control devices for open-field and greenhouse production systems, with particular emphasis on soil moisture sensors (SMSs). SMS regulates the frequency of irrigation and, possibly, the water dose by continuously monitoring volumetric water content (θ) or matrix potential (ψm) of the growing media. A new generation of dielectric SMS has been developed to measure both θ and the electrical conductivity (EC) of pore water in soil and artificial media. This provides the possibility of controlled fertigation based on measured EC. Despite the development in IS, in most regions worldwide, especially in less developed countries, many growers still rely on personal experience for determining crop water requirements and the timing of irrigation. Therefore, the main constraints to the improvement of irrigation efficiency are related to the overall cost of these technologies and to the policies adopted for their dissemination and transfer to professional growers.},

  abstract = {The organic matter in density and particle size fractions of an Andisol and an Inceptisol has been characterised by its C and N contents and infrared spectra. The soils have a similar texture but different clay mineralogy and are under two contrasting land uses represented by pasture and cropping. The Andisol samples were taken from sites which have been under perennial pasture for 100 years and from a pasture site which has been cultivated and cropped with barley and brassica for 20 years. The Inceptisol samples were from sites under native forest and perennial pasture, and from a pasture site which had been cropped with maize for 20 years. The Andisol contained allophane and ferrihydrite whereas the Inceptisol contained mica as the main clay mineral. The CN ratios of the dispersed-light fractions and heavy particle size fractions from the Andisol were in a narrow range of 9–12, and this may be related to the presence of allophane and ferrihydrite. By comparison, the CN ratio of the Inceptisol was close to 9 for the {$<$} 2 Am fractions, 10–12 for the 2–20 Am fraction, 15–18 for the {$>$} 20 μm fraction, and generally highest for the light fractions. This is consistent with the presence of clay minerals with low specific surface area. Infrared spectra indicated that the organic matter associated with the {$<$} 2 μm fraction was enriched in aliphatic groups. Soil carbon in the 0–20 cm layer of the Andisol was 10 T/ha lower under cropping (134 T/ha) than under pasture (144 T/ha). By comparison, the Inceptisol was 23 T/ha lower under cropping (50 T/ha) than under pasture (73 T/ha) suggesting that the turnover of C was more rapid in the Inceptisol. Simulations of C and N turnover for the Andisol using CENTURY indicated that the pool of passive organic matter was very large. For soils with variable charge, of which the Andisol is an example, a modifying factor such as specific surface area may be required in order to give a close simulation of C and N turnover. The data indicate that the stability of organic matter is greater in the Andisol than in the Inceptisol, and it is less likely to be affected by cropping. Allophane and ferrihydrite appear to have a stabilising influence on a large part of the organic matter in the Andisol.},

The impact of micro(nano)plastics on organisms and ecosystems is not fully understood neither in the field nor the laboratory because of the lack of analytical methods that allow to accurately detect and quantify the exposure. This is particularly true for small sized microplastics and nanoplastics, whose quali-quantification is troublesome. Different analytical techniques can be used to measure micro(nano)plastics levels in different matrices, but recently the application of thermal analysis emerged as a promising approach. This review highlights the importance and the advantages of thermal analyses to assess the exposure to micro(nano)plastics in ecotoxicological and toxicological studies.},

  abstract = {The fate, properties and determination of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in soil are poorly known. In fact, most of the 300 million tons of plastics produced each year ends up in the environment and the soil acts as a log-term sink for these plastic debris. Therefore, the aim of this review is to discuss MP and NP pollution in soil as well as highlighting the knowledge gaps that are mainly related to the complexity of the soil ecosystem. The fate of MPs and NPs in soil is strongly determined by physical properties of plastics, whereas negligible effect is exerted by their chemical structures. The degradative processes of plastic, termed ageing, besides generating micro-and nano-size debris, can induce marked changes in their chemical and physical properties with relevant effects on their reactivity. Further, these processes could cause the release of toxic oligomeric and monomeric constituents from plastics, as well as toxic additives, which may enter in the food chain, representing a possible hazard to human health and potentially affecting the fauna and flora in the environment. In relation to their persistence in soil, the list of soil-inhabiting, plastic-eating bacteria, fungi and insect is increasing daily. One of the main ecological functions attributable to MPs is related to their function as vectors for microorganisms through the soil. However, the main ecological effect of NPs (limited to the fraction size \&lt; than 50 nm) is their capacity to pass through the membrane of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Soil biota, particularly earthworms and collembola, can be both MPs and NPs carriers through soil profile. The use of molecular techniques, especially omics approaches, can gain insights into the effects of MPs and NPs on composition and activity of microbial communities inhabiting the soil and into those living on MPs surface and in the gut of the soil plastic-ingesting fauna.},

  abstract = {The increasing pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with plastic debris leads to the accumulation of microscopic plastic particles of still unknown amount. To monitor the degree of contamination, analytical methods are urgently needed, which help to quantify microplastics (MP). Currently, time-costly purified materials enriched on filters are investigated both by micro-infrared spectroscopy and/or micro-Raman. Although yielding precise results, these techniques are time consuming, and are restricted to the analysis of a small part of the sample in the order of few micrograms. To overcome these problems, we tested a macroscopic dimensioned near-infrared (NIR) process-spectroscopic method in combination with chemometrics. For calibration, artificial MP/ soil mixtures containing defined ratios of polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polystyrene with diameters {$<$}\,125~μm were prepared and measured by a process FT-NIR spectrometer equipped with a fiber-optic reflection probe. The resulting spectra were processed by chemometric models including support vector machine regression (SVR), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Validation of models by MP mixtures, MP-free soils, and real-world samples, e.g., fermenter residue, suggests a reliable detection and a possible classification of MP at levels above 0.5 to 1.0 mass\% depending on the polymer. The benefit of the combined NIRS chemometric approach lies in the rapid assessment whether soil contains MP, without any chemical pretreatment. The method can be used with larger sample volumes and even allows for an online prediction and thus meets the demand of a high-throughput method.},

This can be achieved using plastics with specific spectral properties as crop covers. We have studied the responses of a range of crops to plastics that have either (a) increased transmission of UV compared with standard horticultural covers, (b) decreased transmission of UV or (c) increased the ratio of red (R) : far-red (FR) radiation. Both the UV-transparent and R : FR increasing films reduced leaf area and biomass, offering potential alternatives to chemical growth regulators. The UV-opaque film increased growth, but while this may be useful in some crops, there were tradeoffs with elements of quality, such as pigmentation and taste. UV manipulation may also influence disease control. Increasing UV inhibited not only the pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea but also the disease biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum. Unlike B. cinerea, T. harzianum was highly sensitive to UV-A radiation. These fungal responses and those for plant growth in the growth room and the field under different plastics are analyzed in terms of alternative biological spectral weighting functions (BSWF). The role of BSWF in assessing general patterns of response to UV modification in horticulture is also discussed.},

  abstract = {With the existing analytical pyrolysis systems (e.g., thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pyroprobe, drop tube furnace, etc.) that are available on the market, it is not possible to monitor the real temperature of a sample or visualize the transformation of the solids. Furthermore, typical sample preparation methods (e.g., using a powder) result in poor mass and heat transfer, because of large sample thickness and the explosion of particles during the heating regime. To study and address these problems, (i) a new experimental setup was designed to allow temperature measurement and pyrolysis sample visualization using a CDS Pyroprobe 5000; (ii) the system was completely characterized with cellulose (85.7 μm thick) as the solid sample; and (iii) preliminary results showed the propulsion of cellulose particles out of the quartz sample tube, which could be a major source of error. As a result, a thin sample film was used for further experimentation. Pyrolysis experiments using cellulose were performed under near-vacuum conditions (3.5 mbar) and at near-atmospheric pressure (950 mbar) to gain insight into the effect of pressure on pyrolysis. The temperature of the samples and the yield of solid residue (char) were measured. Results showed that the heating rate of the sample was much slower than the heating rate of the platinum coil. Furthermore, endothermic reactions suppressed the heating rate as the temperature rose above 400 °C. Data was extracted from videos of pyrolysis at both pressures to track the darkening of the solid samples. A computer simulation of these experiments including heat, mass, and momentum transport at 3.5 and 950 mbar shows how operation at different pressures and heating rates affect the generation and distribution of pyrolysis products. These simulations indicate that convective heat transfer dominates over radiative heat transfer to the cellulose sample at high and low pressures if the heating coil is wrapped tightly around the quartz sample tube. However, radiative heat transfer is somewhat more important at lower pressures where the gas-phase thermal conductivity is smaller, especially if the heating coil is loosely wrapped around the sample tube.},

The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in five of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg kg−1. The highest levels (91–100 mg kg−1) were in oily foods such as garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i.e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6–173 mg kg−1. The highest concentrations (99–173 mg kg−1) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products such as sauce béarnaise and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared with the legal limit of 60 mg kg−1. The results ranged from 76 to 519 mg kg−1 and as a consequence the products were withdrawn from the market.},

  abstract = {Microplastic (0.001–5 mm) is a serious problem for the environment and is globally distributed. It has been detected in marine and limnic waters as well as in organisms. Until now, microplastic (MP) particles in environmental samples are mainly identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) or Raman spectroscopy. Usually, for quantitative detection, time-consuming counting of MP particles in the sample is described. Therefore, a great need for research in the field of size-independent quantitative analysis of MP particles is evident. We present herein the application of quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy (qNMR) as a new method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of MP in solution. Polyethylene (PE) granules with a size distribution of {$<$} 300 μm, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers with a length of approx. 500 μm, and polystyrene (PS) beads with a size distribution of 0.5–1 mm were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed as prototypical MP particles in model samples using a calibration curve method. As internal standard, the residual proton signal of the deuterated solvent was used. For all polymer types, linearity of the method is {$>$} 0.994 R2, and the precision is in the range of 99.4–99.9\%. The limit of detection (LOD) is in the range of 19–21 μg/mL and the limit of the quantification (LOQ) is in the range of 74–85 mg/mL, so the LOD and LOQ are observed in an environmentally relevant size. In this work, we therefore show that size-independent qualitative and quantitative determination of microplastic particles in model samples using qNMR is possible.

Currently, quantification of MP particles in environmental samples and the comparability of different matrices is a major research topic. Research also focusses on sample preparation, since environmental samples must be free of inorganic and organic matrix components for the MP analysis. Therefore, we would like to propose a new method that allows the comparison of the results of MP analysis from different environmental matrices and gives a MP concentration in mass of MP particles per gram of environmental sample. This is possible by developing and validating an optimized and consistent sample preparation scheme for quantitative analysis of MP particles in environmental model samples in conjunction with quantitative 1H-NMR spectroscopy (qNMR). We evaluated for the first time the effects of different environmental matrices on identification and quantification of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers using the qNMR method. Furthermore, high recovery rates were obtained from spiked environmental model samples (without matrix \textasciitilde{} 90\%, sediment \textasciitilde{} 97\%, freshwater \textasciitilde{} 94\%, aquatic biofilm \textasciitilde{} 95\%, and invertebrate matrix \textasciitilde{} 72\%), demonstrating the high analytical potential of the method.

  abstract = {Uncontrolled land disposal of olive mill waste water (OMW) can potentially result in soil pollution as a consequence of its high chemical and biochemical oxygen demand and high concentration of phytotoxic phenolic compounds. Although both positive and negative effects of OMW on soil quality have been reported, no clear consensus regarding its direct influence on soil hydrophobicity or soil organic matter (SOM) quality is apparent. An improved understanding of any changes in SOM quality would benefit from expanding current characterization approaches to include the determination of SOM stability and physico-chemical properties. In this screening study we investigated topsoils of sites in West Bank and Israel which have been subjected to a significant OMW disposal for several years. In most cases, amounts and disposal method are unknown. In addition to properties such as water repellency and sorption capacity, novel approaches that included carbon isotope ratio (δ13C), thermostability index (TS) and contact angle tensiometry were tested. All polluted soils exhibited stronger water repellency and, in multiple cases, higher sorptive capacity for agrochemicals and were depleted in δ13C. This coincided with higher organic carbon and water extractable organic matter contents with the magnitude of effects clearly stronger than those generally reported for controlled OMW disposal. Extractable organic matter of polluted soils contained higher amounts of non-aromatic compounds like fatty acids and sugars than their controls. Thermal analysis indicated a relative reduction of the recalcitrant OM compared to the controls although interestingly, individual calorific values were higher than those of the unpolluted controls.

  abstract = {Microplastic waste is a worldwide problem, heavily afflicting marine and freshwater environments; the loading of this pollution in water, sediment and living organisms continues to escalate. Synthetic microfibers, resulting from the release of microscopic fibers from synthetic textiles, constitute the most prevalent type of microplastics pollution in aquatic environments. This study investigated the origin and distribution of synthetic microfibers in a representative Lake Michigan watershed in Indiana (USA) by analyzing water, sediment and air samples above and below wastewater treatment plant discharges, downstream in the watershed and water from the Lake Michigan shoreline. Synthetic microfibers were also quantified in wastewater from a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in laundry effluent. Laboratory testing of numerous fabrics suggests that Fenton oxidation, used to break down natural fibers, effectively eliminates non-polluting, natural fibers from the samples. However, the hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation bleaches the dye from certain synthetic microfibers, which likely leads to under-reported values for these microplastics in natural samples. The data collected from the watershed samples indicate that approximately 4 billion synthetic microfibers are transported daily through the Lake Michigan tributary. Wastewater effluent is not the only source of synthetic microfibers, since surface water samples above the WWTP contained a similar load to downstream samples. Repeated sampling exhibited variability in the number of microfibers detected, substantiating the heterogeneous distribution of these pollutants and the requirement for multiple samples for a given site. The average load of synthetic microfibers from water sampled at the Lake Michigan shoreline was higher than the tributary water, suggesting the shoreline functions as a repository for the microfibers. Given the extent and potential consequences of this pollution, quantification of the ubiquitous plastic fibers can be instituted as part of the traditional total suspended solids (TSS) water quality monitoring parameter.},

  abstract = {Thermal analysis techniques can provide an important addition to our understanding of soil organic matter (SOM) composition and stability. Several recent studies have linked thermal and biological stability of SOM; however, contrasting results have been reported. The objective of this study was to characterize the relationships between thermal and biological SOM stability for a wide range of mineral soils. Soils were collected from 28 sites from across the United States and analyzed by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) coupled with CO2 evolved gas analysis (CO2–EGA). We compared thermal analysis results to mean soil respiration rates during incubation at 20°C for 365 d (R20). For soils with \textbackslash textless30 g C kg-1 (low C), R20 was negatively correlated with the temperature at which half of the DSC energy is released and the temperature at which half of the CO2–EGA is evolved. Conversely, for soils with \textbackslash textgreater30 g C kg-1 (high C), R20 was positively correlated with CO2–EGA and DSC energy released between 345 and 460°C and to SOM energy density (in J mg-1 C). Differences between low-C and high-C soils indicate the relative importance of mineral association of SOM in low-C soils and the abundance of intact plant debris that is relatively energy dense and thermally resistant but relatively easy to decompose in high-C soils. Above all, thermal analysis proved to be a useful technique for interpreting SOM stability, but sample C concentration must be considered because it affects the dominant SOM stabilization mechanisms and thermal analysis results.},

Using four geographic sources, we found that dark mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio obscurus) ate PS as well. We subsequently tested T. obscurus from Shandong, China for PS degradation capability. Our results demonstrated the ability for PS degradation within the gut of T. obscurus at greater rates than T. molitor. With expanded PS foam as the sole diet, the specific PS consumption rates for T. obscurus and T. molitor at similar sizes (2.0 cm, 62–64 mg per larva) were 32.44 ± 0.51 and 24.30 ± 1.34 mg 100 larvae–1 d–1, respectively. After 31 days, the molecular weight (Mn) of residual PS in frass (excrement) of T. obscurus decreased by 26.03\%, remarkably higher than that of T. molitor (11.67\%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated formation of functional groups of intermediates and chemical modification. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested that T. obscurus larvae degraded PS effectively based on the proportion of PS residue. Co-fed corn flour to T. obscurus and wheat bran to T. molitor increased total PS consumption by 11.6\% and 15.2\%, respectively. Antibiotic gentamicin almost completely inhibited PS depolymerization. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant shifts in the gut microbial community in both Tenebrio species that were associated with the PS diet and PS biodegradation, with changes in three predominant families (Enterobacteriaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Enterococcaceae). The results indicate that PS biodegradability may be ubiquitous within the Tenebrio genus which could provide a bioresource for plastic waste biodegradation.},

The formation of hydroxyl radical (OH) as a possible decomposition intermediate was investigated using a new, highly sensitive method. In surface soils with higher organic matter or manganese content, H2O2 usually decayed rapidly, with disproportionation to water and dioxygen dominating the decomposition, whereas the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH) represented {$<$}10\% of the total H2O2 decomposed. In contrast, for soils with lower organic matter content, H2O2 usually decayed much more slowly, but OH was a major product of the H2O2 decomposed. The decomposition was principally associated with soil particles, not the soil supernatant. Different sterilization techniques indicated that decomposition of H2O2 was at least partly due to biological activity. Because the loss of H2O2 can largely be accommodated by the production of O2 and OH within these soils, our results suggest that disproportionation through a catalase-type mechanism and the production of OH through a Haber-Weiss mechanism represent the principal routes through which H2O2 is lost.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous presence and persistency of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments are of particular concern since they represent an increasing threat to marine organisms and ecosystems. Great differences of concentrations and/or quantities in field samples have been observed depending on geographical location around the world. The main types reported have been polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. The presence of MPs in marine wildlife has been shown in many studies focusing on ingestion and accumulation in different tissues, whereas studies of the biological effects of MPs in the field are scarce. If the nature and abundance/concentrations of MPs have not been systematically determined in field samples, this is due to the fact that the identification of MPs from environmental samples requires mastery and execution of several steps and techniques. For this reason and due to differences in sampling techniques and sample preparation, it remains difficult to compare the published studies. Most laboratory experiments have been performed with MP concentrations of a higher order of magnitude than those found in the field. Consequently, the ingestion and associated effects observed in exposed organisms have corresponded to great contaminant stress, which does not mimic the natural environment. Medium contaminations are produced with only one type of polymer of a precise sizes and homogenous shape whereas the MPs present in the field are known to be a mix of many types, sizes and shapes of plastic. Moreover, MPs originating in marine environments can be colonized by organisms and constitute the sorption support for many organic compounds present in environment that are not easily reproducible in laboratory. Determination of the mechanical and chemical effects of MPs on organisms is still a challenging area of research. Among the potential chemical effects it is necessary to differentiate those related to polymer properties from those due to the sorption/desorption of organic compounds.},

MPs can be directly released to water or formed by the degradation of bigger plastics. Nowadays, it is estimated that annually between 4 and 12 million tonnes of plastic go into the seas and oceans—with a forecast for them to outweigh the amount of fish in 2050. Based on the existing studies, the characterization of MPs in waters is still one of the remaining challenges because they can be easily confused with organic or other types of matter. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to establish pathways for the chemical identification of the MP nature. In this perspective, the recent techniques and instrumentation for MP characterization (Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies and microscopies, pyrolysis and thermal desorption gas chromatography, imaging techniques, etc.) are discussed including considerations to the multidimensionality of the problem. This perspective also summarizes and provides updated data on the sources and occurrence, transport and fate of MPs in aquatic ecosystems, as well as influencing conditions and factors affecting dispersal. Additionally, how engineering and biotechnological tools, such as advanced water treatments, would help to control, reduce, or even eliminate MP pollution in the near future is outlined.},

In this paper, techniques based on remote sensing have been used for an analysis of the rural land use in terms of application of plastics in protected cultivation, in a study area located in Southern Italy near the coastline of the Jonian Sea, where the utilization of plastics in agriculture is widespread. The analysis has been realized using multitemporal Landsat TM images through Supervised classification, image processing, vectorialization and GIS tools. The results enabled the creation of a routine for the auto-detection of the plastic covers. The variation in the visual perception of the agricultural land was examined through a GIS software and a three-dimensional land modelling with solid extrusion and an overlap of the photographic images reproducing plastic-covered protected crops. The results of these simulations could be used for monitoring the variation of rural land use and supporting sound policies of landscape and environmental planning. Through a multi-variate approach to the analysis of environmental and landscape impacts, the concept of a “threshold” limit for the quantity of plastic-covered agricultural structures was proposed, and possible modification of texture and colour of the cladding material mitigating the aesthetic and environmental impact were evaluated.},

At the same time, terrestrial ecosystems under human influence, such as agroecosystems, are likely to be contaminated by plastic debris. However, the extent of this contamination has not been determined at present. Via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, we quantified for the first time the macro- and microplastic contamination on an agricultural farmland in southeast Germany. We found 206 macroplastic pieces per hectare and 0.34\,±\,0.36 microplastic particles per kilogram dry weight~of soil. In general,~polyethylene was the most common polymer type, followed by polystyrene and polypropylene. Films and fragments were the dominating categories found for microplastics, whereas predominantly films were found for macroplastics. Since we intentionally chose a study site where microplastic-containing fertilizers and agricultural plastic applications were never used, our findings report on plastic contamination on a site which only receives conventional agricultural treatment. However, the contamination is probably higher in areas where agricultural plastic applications, like greenhouses, mulch, or silage films, or plastic-containing fertilizers (sewage sludge, biowaste composts) are applied. Hence, further research on the extent of this contamination is needed with special regard to different cultivation practices.},

Little is known, however, on how temperature affects the most important groups of the soil microorganisms, the bacteria and the fungi, in situ. We have therefore measured the instantaneous total activity (respiration rate), bacterial activity (growth rate as thymidine incorporation rate) and fungal activity (growth rate as acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation rate) in soil at different temperatures (0–45 °C). Two soils were compared: one was an agricultural soil low in organic matter and with high pH, and the other was a forest humus soil with high organic matter content and low pH. Fungal and bacterial growth rates had optimum temperatures around 25–30 °C, while at higher temperatures lower values were found. This decrease was more drastic for fungi than for bacteria, resulting in an increase in the ratio of bacterial to fungal growth rate at higher temperatures. A tendency towards the opposite effect was observed at low temperatures, indicating that fungi were more adapted to low-temperature conditions than bacteria. The temperature dependence of all three activities was well modelled by the square root (Ratkowsky) model below the optimum temperature for fungal and bacterial growth. The respiration rate increased over almost the whole temperature range, showing the highest value at around 45 °C. Thus, at temperatures above 30 °C there was an uncoupling between the instantaneous respiration rate and bacterial and fungal activity. At these high temperatures, the respiration rate closely followed the Arrhenius temperature relationship.},

In contrast, the municipal solid waste compost led to a notable accumulation of metals in the soil, in the vegetation and in the musts.

Understanding sources will be of key importance in efforts to reduce emissions into the environment. We examined the emissions of microfibers from domestic washing of a new microfiber polyester fleece textile. Analyzing released fibers collected with a 200 mu m filter during 10 mild, successive washing cycles showed that emission initially decreased and then stabilized at approx. 0.0012 wt\%. This value is our estimation for the long-term release of fibers during each washing. Use of detergent and softener did not significantly influence emission. Release of fibers during tumble drying was approx. 3.5 times higher than during washing.},

Winter rowcovers increased air temperatures by 1 to 2C without advancing bloom or harvest date. Significant blossom temperature differences relative to rowcover materials (≈ 1.5C) and irrigation use (≈ 1.5 to 3.0C) were detected over the course of six spring frosts. Time of application of covers (winter or spring) and irrigation in spring interacted in their effects on early yields (25 Apr.-5 May). However, rowcover and irrigation treatments did not have a significant effect on total marketable yield, yield per plant, or berry mass. In the absence of higher prices for early than late-season fruit or of more severe environmental extremes than experienced in the current study, it would be difficult to justify the added expense of rowcovers.},

Pre-treating the soil with o.1N HC1 increased the yield of humic acid obtained with the alkaline extractants. An additional pre-treatment with a mixture, which was normal with respect to HC1 and HF, gave a slight reduction in yield. Increasing the temperature of extraction increased the yield of humic acid. The total C extracted was usually in excess of the humic acid recovered. The difference was obtained as ‘humins’. The sum of the Fe2O3, SiO2, and A12O3 contents of the humic acids was always less than 2 per cent. Where the extraction was carried out at room temperatures the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio suggested that they might be present as clay mineral. When extraction was carried out at an elevated temperature this ratio was altered. Humic acids of low ash content (0.1–0.5 per cent) could be obtained by the use of hot reagents. Of all the extractants used at room temperature, pyrophosphate produced the humic acid of lowest ash content (∼ 0.2 per cent). The Fe2O3 content of the humic acids was not correlated with their SiO2 or A12O3 content. The N-content of the humic acids was substantially independent of the method of extraction. The cation-exchange capacities (C.E.C.), average pK values and range of pK values, have been determined from the titration curves of the humic acids. These quantities vary with the method of extraction. There are good correlations between cation exchange capacity and both average pK values and the range of pK values. The within-molecule variation of pK values appears to be greater than the between-molecule variation. No correlation exists between C.E.C. and Fe, Al, Si, and N content of the humic acids.},

  abstract = {The choice of prospective type of farming requires knowledge about the specific relationships that exist between farm management practices and base environmental conditions. Nowadays the protection of soil organic carbon is one of the main tasks, because organic carbon in addition to soil fertility can act in elimination of soil contamination and carbon sequestration. Field experiments were focused on the effect of intensive farming without organic inputs versus grassland on organic carbon content. Organic carbon content (Cox) and humic substance fractions (C-humic acids and fulvic acid fractions), hot water extractable carbon and selected microbial characteristics in Eutric Cambisol were monitored during the period 1999–2010. A priming effect of soil cultivation was detected immediately after tillage. Arable soil with ‘intensive’ crop sequences (exclusively cash crops, cereals, oil plants) and with an optimal level of chemical inputs (mineral fertilizers, pesticides), but without organic farmyard manure had lower content of all carbon forms compared with grassland. 13C NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis (TGA) were applied to characterize humic acid (HA) structure and stability. More carbon, less oxygen and more aromatic compounds were detected in grassland HA. Slight differences were found in HA thermo-oxidative stability and degradability, which was probably caused by changes in elemental composition and structure. Even the land use had no significant effect on basic microbiological characteristics (basal respiration, microbial biomass and qCO2); the physiology of the microbial community of grassland was altered by a higher ability to utilize L- and D-glutamic acid. The L/D ratio of glutamic acid mineralization indicated no occurrence of stress in soil for both types of farming. It has been demonstrated that although losses of carbon as a result of land-use conversions are generally more rapid, gains of carbon in grassland followed by changes in management practices can also occur.},

These systems rely on ecosystem services provided by natural ecosystems, including pollination, biological pest control, maintenance of soil structure and fertility, nutrient cycling and hydrological services. Preliminary assessments indicate that the value of these ecosystem services to agriculture is enormous and often underappreciated. Agroecosystems also produce a variety of ecosystem services, such as regulation of soil and water quality, carbon sequestration, support for biodiversity and cultural services. Depending on management practices, agriculture can also be the source of numerous disservices, including loss of wildlife habitat, nutrient runoff, sedimentation of waterways, greenhouse gas emissions, and pesticide poisoning of humans and non-target species. The tradeoffs that may occur between provisioning services and other ecosystem services and disservices should be evaluated in terms of spatial scale, temporal scale and reversibility. As more effective methods for valuing ecosystem services become available, the potential for ‘win–win’ scenarios increases. Under all scenarios, appropriate agricultural management practices are critical to realizing the benefits of ecosystem services and reducing disservices from agricultural activities.},

In this study, we have stepwise optimized the chromatographic parameters of 1D, comprising gradient slope and temperature, using model homo- and copolymers of ethylene with the aim to minimize the impact of molar mass on the compositional separation. Then the HT-HPLC was hyphenated to HT-SEC and optimum conditions for the volume of the sample transfer loop were probed with regard to the resolution of BiHDPE into the individual constituents HDPE and LLDPE. A particular important aspect was the use of infrared (IR) detection, and the demands it puts on the chromatographic aspects: We have shown that IR detection can be successfully applied in HT 2D-LC of BiHDPE, which is broadly distributed with regard to short chain branching and molar mass, only when the separation in 2D is optimized with regard to chromatographic resolution. As final result a bimodality is evident in the contour and the 3D surface plots as well as in both HPLC and SEC projections generated from HT 2D-LC.},

Current clean-up strategies have attempted to mitigate the negative effects of plastic pollution but are unable to compete with increasing quantities of plastic entering the environment. Thus, reducing inputs of plastic to the environment must be prioritized through a global multidisciplinary approach. Mismanaged waste is a major land-based source of plastic pollution that can be reduced through improvements in the life-cycle of plastics, especially in production, consumption, and disposal, through an Integrated Waste Management System. In this review paper, we discuss current practices to improve life cycle and waste management of plastics that can be implemented to reduce health and environmental impacts of plastics and reduce plastics pollution. Ten recommendations for stakeholders to reduce plastic pollution include (1) regulation of production and consumption; (2) eco-design; (3) increasing the demand for recycled plastics; (4) reducing the use of plastics; (5) use of renewable energy for recycling; (6) extended producer responsibility over waste; (7) improvements in waste collection systems; (8) prioritization of recycling; (9) use of bio-based and biodegradable plastics; and (10) improvement in recyclability of e-waste.},

In terrestrial environments, microfibres (MFs) generated from textile laundering are believed to form a significant component of MPs entering soils, mainly through sewage sludge and compost applications. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of MFs on a keystone soil organism. We exposed the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris to soil with polyester MFs incorporated at rates of 0, 0.1 and 1.0 \%w/w MF for a period of 35 days (in the dark at 15 °C; n = 4 for each treatment). Dried plant litter was applied at the soil surface as a food source for the earthworms. We assessed earthworm vitality through mortality, weight change, depurate production and MF avoidance testing. In addition, we measured stress biomarker responses via the expression of metallothionein-2 (mt-2), heat shock protein (hsp70) and superoxide dismutase (sod-1). Our results showed that exposure and ingestion of MFs (as evidenced by subsequent retrieval of MFs within earthworm depurates) were not lethal to earthworms, nor did earthworms actively avoid MFs. However, earthworms in the MF1.0\% treatment showed a 1.5-fold lower cast production, a 24.3-fold increase in expression of mt-2 (p {$<$} 0.001) and a 9.9-fold decline in hsp70 expression (p {$<$} 0.001). Further analysis of soil and MF samples indicated that metal content was not a contributor to the biomarker results. Given that burrowing and feeding behaviour, as well as molecular genetic biomarkers, were modulated in earthworms exposed to MFs, our study highlights potential implications for soil ecosystem processes due to MF contamination.},

Decisions on husbandry, rotational systems, machinery, fertilisation and pest management do indeed affect the landscape in crucial ways and landscape dynamics cannot be understood if the farmer’s decision making and the surrounding technology, socio-economics, and organisational structure are ignored. However, normally the farmer is not the only decision maker. Often he farms leased land and the owner may be an equally important actor concerning landscape changes. Even when the farmer and the owner are the same person, the ‘owner’ may take very different types of decisions than the ‘producer’ does. Many of these decisions concern the landscape as a ‘living place’ (in the sense of a place to live in) rather than as a production area. Decisions linked to the landscape as a living place have been overlooked in landscape research, yet are playing a growing role due to occupational changes in the countryside and changes in agricultural subsidies (from production to land-based subsidies), and to the growing interest in environmental protection and enhancement. I argue that the owner is a key person in changes of the structural part of the landscape and should be included in landscape research and also be considered as a key actor by the planning authorities. Empirical data from an extensive interview survey of 700 farmland and woodland owners in Denmark are used to support the argument, and finally some implications for landscape planning and public regulations are discussed.},

Reliable methods are urgently needed for the identification and quantification of these emerging environmental pollutants. Recently a rapid Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging pipeline was developed for automated identification and quantification of MP. However, although the usefulness for the quantification of MP could already be shown in several studies, microfibres could not be targeted so far by the developed analysis pipeline. In this study we present a novel approach for the simultaneous identification and quantification of MP and MF. By concentrating the sample on membrane filters and applying a BaF2 window on top of the filter, all objects – including MF – are fixed in the focal plane of the FTIR microscope. Furthermore, the analysis pipeline was augmented with algorithms which take into consideration the filamentous structure of MF. The novel analysis pipeline now allows to separate MP and MF via a preselection of fibres from the dataset by object size and shape. MP and MF are subsequently further investigated for specific polymer types and lengths/sizes. After parameter optimization the newly developed analysis approach was applied to archived samples from previous studies on treated waste water. The results were compared with respect to the original detected polymer types and numbers, but also considered MF detection.},

In this study, we compare the results of hyperspectral Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) imaging analysis and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis performed on a set of environmental samples that differ in complexity and degree of microplastic contamination. The measurements were conducted consecutively, and on exactly the same sample. First, the samples were investigated with FTIR using aluminum oxide filters; subsequently, these were crushed, transferred to glass fiber filters, in pyrolysis cups, and measured via Py-GC/MS. After a general data harmonization step, the trends in MP contamination were thoroughly investigated with regard to the respective sample set and the derived polymer compositions. While the overall trends in MP contamination were very similar, differences were observed in the polymer compositions. Furthermore, polymer masses were empirically calculated from FTIR data and compared with the Py-GC/MS results. Here, a most plausible shape-related overestimation of the calculated polymer masses was observed in samples with larger particles and increased particle numbers. Taking into account the different measurement principles of both methods, all results were examined and discussed, and future needs for harmonization of intermethodological results were identified and highlighted.},

The novel database design is based on the hierarchical cluster analysis of reference spectra in the spectral range from 3600 to 1250 cm−1. The hereby generated database entries were optimized for the automated analysis software with defined reference datasets. The design was further tested for its customizability with additional entries. The final reference database was extensively tested on reference datasets and environmental samples. Data quality by means of correct particle identification and depiction significantly increased compared to that of previous databases, proving the applicability of the concept and highlighting the importance of this work. Our novel database provides a reference point for data comparison with future and previous microplastic studies that are based on different databases. Open image in new window Graphical abstract ᅟ},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution is globally widespread; however, the presence of microplastics in soil systems is poorly understood, due to the complexity of soils and a lack of standardised extraction methods. Two commonly used extraction methods were optimised and compared for the extraction of low-density (polyethylene (PE)) and high-density microplastics (polyethylene (PET)), olive-oil-based extraction, and density separation with zinc chloride (ZnCl2). Comparable recoveries in a low-organic-matter matrix (soil; most \&gt;98\%) were observed, but in a high-organic-matter matrix (compost), density separation yielded higher recoveries (98 \&plusmn; 4\% vs. 80 \&plusmn; 11\%). Density separation was further tested for the extraction of five microplastic polymers spiked at different concentrations. Recoveries were \&gt;93\% for both soil and compost, with no differences between matrices and individual polymers. Reduction in levels of organic matter in compost was tested before and after extraction, as well as combined. Double oxidation (Fenton\&rsquo;s reagent and 1 M NaOH) exhibited the highest reduction in organic matter. Extracted microplastic polymers were further identified via headspace solid-phase microextraction\&ndash;gas chromatography\&ndash;mass spectrometry (HS-SPME\&ndash;GC\&ndash;MS). This method has shown the potential for descriptive quantification of microplastic polymers. A linear relationship between the number of particles and the signal response was demonstrated for PET, polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and PE (R2 \&gt; 0.98 in alluvial soil, and R2 \&gt; 0.80 in compost). The extraction and identification methods were demonstrated on an environmental sample of municipal biowaste compost, with the recovery of 36 \&plusmn; 9 microplastic particles per 10 g of compost, and the detection of PS and PP.},

Procedures of sample fractionation and transfer are often insufficiently reported, although fractionating a sample in similarly sized particles is a crucial prerequisite for the subsequent detection and identification process. At the same time, fractionation is error-prone as particles can be lost during transfer between different vessels. This article presents a four-step technique of sample preparation and microscopic examination, suited for different kind of environmental samples (e.g., water, sediment, soil): The sample is size-fractionated in a sieve cascade (I), rinsed from the sieve and vacuum-filtrated onto a filter (II), rinsed from the filter into a glass petri dish with a low amount of water (III), and examined under the microscope in wet or dry condition (IV). The technique manages on standard laboratory equipment and is reliable for fragments {$>~$}300~µm: In a validation experiment with polypropylene, the average recovery was 94~±~13.5\% (arithmetic mean ± standard deviation) and 100\% (median), respectively.•Reliable sample transfer after wet-sieving.•Concentration of the pretreated sample in a very small amount of water.•Usage of transmitted light in microscopy.},

Three soils subjected to different treatments (sewage sludge application, irrigation by, saline waters, and contamination by industrial and municipal wastes) were sampled and their sterol content was measured and compared with adjacent untreated soils. The effects of time, location, and treatment were evaluated by means of a number of statistical techniques. beta-Sitosterol concentration varied from 0.9 to 30 mg kg(-1). Lesser values were measured in Cremona (2.1 mg kg(-1)) than in Bari (4.0 mg kg(-1)) and Naples (10.9 mg kg(-1)) soils. No significant effects were detected for cholesterol and ergosterol. Coprostanol was present after sewage sludge disposal and contamination by industrial,and municipal-wastes, while it was absent in the soil treated with saline water and in the adjacent untreated soil. Coprostanol concentration did not-vary much within site and time sampling with a value of 0.2 mg kg(-1). We confirmed coprostanol as a useful persistent marker of human fecal matter contamination. Multivariate analysis high, lighted a clear distinction between the eukaryotic sterols and coprostanol. In addition, a different behavior between ergosterol and cholesterol on one side and P-sitosterol on the other was detected. This preliminary work suggests that sterols deserve a deeper study of their use as indicators in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {It is now widely acknowledged that microplastic pollution represents one of the greatest anthropogenically mediated threats to Earth-system functioning. In freshwater and marine ecosystems the presence of large amounts of microplastic appears almost ubiquitous, with frequent reports of negative impacts on aquatic health. In contrast, however, the impact of plastic in terrestrial environments remains poorly understood. In agroecosystems, microplastics (particles {$<$} 5 mm) can enter the soil environment either directly (e.g. from biosolids application, irrigation water, atmospheric deposition), or indirectly through the in situ degradation of large pieces of plastic (e.g. from plastic mulch films). Although we have encouraged the use of plastics over the last 50 years in agriculture to promote greater resource use efficiency and food security, the legacy of this is that many soils are now contaminated with large amounts of plastic residue (ca. 50–250 kg ha−1). Due to difficulties in separating and quantifying plastic particles from soil, our knowledge of their behavior, fate and potential to transfer to other receptors (e.g. surface and groundwater, air) and enter the human food chain remains poor. This information, however, is critical for evaluating the risk of soil-borne microplastic pollution. In this critical review, we systematically summarize (i) the distribution and migration of microplastics in soils, (ii) highlight the separation, extraction, and identification methods for monitoring microplastics in soils, (iii) discuss the ecological effects and pollution mechanisms of soil microplastics, (iv) propose mitigation strategies to help prevent and reduce microplastic pollution, and (v) identify the most important future challenges in soil microplastics research.},

  abstract = {The plastic mulch films used in agriculture are considered to be a major source of the plastic residues found in soil. Mulching with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is widely practiced and the resulting macro- and microscopic plastic residues in agricultural soil have aroused concerns for years. Over the past decades, a variety of biodegradable (Bio) plastics have been developed in the hope of reducing plastic contamination of the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the impact of these Bio plastics in agroecosystems have not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, we investigated the impact of macro (around 5~mm) and micro ({$<$}1~mm) sized plastic debris from LDPE and one type of starch-based Bio mulch film on soil physicochemical and hydrological properties. We used environmentally relevant concentrations of plastics, ranging from 0 to 2\% (w/w), identified by field studies and literature review. We studied the effects of the plastic residue on a sandy soil for one month in a laboratory experiment. The bulk density, porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, field capacity and soil water repellency were altered significantly in the presence of the four kinds of plastic debris, while pH, electrical conductivity and aggregate stability were not substantially affected. Overall, our research provides clear experimental evidence that microplastics affect soil properties. The type, size and content of plastic debris as well as the interactions between these three factors played complex roles in the variations of the measured soil parameters. Living in a plastic era, it is crucial to conduct further interdisciplinary studies in order to have a comprehensive understanding of plastic debris in soil and agroecosystems.},

In this study, low density polyethylene and one type of starch-based biodegradable plastic mulch film were selected and used as examples of macro- and micro- sized plastic residues. A pot experiment was performed in a climate chamber to determine what effect mixing 1\% concentration of residues of these plastics with sandy soil would have on wheat growth in the presence and absence of earthworms. The results showed that macro- and micro- plastic residues affected both above-ground and below-ground parts of the wheat plant during both vegetative and reproductive growth. The type of plastic mulch films used had a strong effect on wheat growth with the biodegradable plastic mulch showing stronger negative effects as compared to polyethylene. The presence of earthworms had an overall positive effect on the wheat growth and chiefly alleviated the impairments made by plastic residues.},

However, not all biodegradable plastics are completely degradable under natural conditions. Some of them may be disintegrated into microplastics more rapidly than conventional plastics, emerging as another threat to soil environments. As a part of microplastics, biodegradable microplastics may pose stronger negative effects on several soil species than oil-based microplastics under some conditions. Currently, there is a fiercely increasing trend to replace nondegradable plastic commodities with biodegradable ones. Therefore, to discuss the ecological safety of biodegradable plastics is essential before promoting wide application of them during commercial use. This review provided a brief introduction on biodegradable plastics and summarized their deterioration behaviors in terrestrial environments, together with evidences on releases of additives and biodegradable microplastics. Then, potential adverse effects of biodegradable microplastics in soil ecosystems, including responses on soil properties, microbial communities, and several soil species were discussed, suggesting biodegradable microplastics as a potential threat to ecological safety of soil ecosystems. By this token, biodegradable plastics might not be a panacea to the existing “white pollution” and need further exploring.},

Reported effects of mulching are sometimes contradictory, likely due to differences in climatic conditions, soil characteristics, crop species and also water and nitrogen (N) input levels. Here we report on a meta-analysis of the effects of mulching on wheat and maize, using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries. Our results indicate that mulching significantly increased yields, WUE (yield per unit water) and NUE (yield per unit N) by up to 60\%, compared with no-mulching. Effects were larger for maize than wheat and larger for plastic mulching than straw mulching. Interestingly, plastic mulching performed better at relatively low temperature while straw mulching showed the opposite trend. Effects of mulching also tended to decrease with increasing water input. Mulching effects were not related to soil organic matter content. In conclusion, soil mulching can significantly increase maize and wheat yields, WUE and NUE and thereby may contribute to closing the yield gap between attainable and actual yields, especially in dryland and low nutrient input agriculture. The management of soil mulching requires site-specific knowledge.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of MPs in agricultural soils, wastewater effluents and sewage sludge in Mauritius. The soil samples were collected randomly from three different agricultural lands which have been used for conventional agriculture for more than 25 years. Wastewater effluents and sewage sludge were collected once, using the grab sampling method, from three main operating wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) across the island and were analysed in triplicate. MPs were extracted using the flotation technique, followed by hydrogen peroxide digestion. The abundance of MPs was found to be 320.0 ± 112.2 and 420.0 ± 244.0 particles.kg-1 in shallow and deep soils, respectively, out of which 42.4\% and 95.8\% were less than 1 mm in size, respectively. Site 3 had the highest abundance of MPs due to cumulated plastic debris dumped on the field. In addition, the average MPs concentration in sewage sludge and in wastewater effluents were 14,750 ± 8612.9 particles.kg-1 and 276.3 ± 137.3 particles.L-1, respectively, whereby 90\% of the MPs were less than 0.5 mm in size. WWTP 1 had the largest share of MPs in both sewage sludge and wastewater effluents. The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that polypropylene (fibres, fragments, and flakes) was in abundance in agricultural soil samples by 56.26\%, while in WWTP polyamide (fibres) was predominant by 88.85\%. The findings of this preliminary study confirmed the presence of MPs in Mauritian lands, wastewater effluents and sewage sludge and therefore provide salient data to advocate for subsequent research on MPs.},

However, owing to lack of appropriate management practices, the production and the area under cultivation of groundnut have remained low. Mulches increase the soil temperature, retard the loss of soil moisture, and check the weed growth, which are the key factors contributing to the production of groundnut. On-farm trials were conducted in northern Vietnam to study the impact of mulch treatments and explore economically feasible and eco-friendly mulching options. The effect of three mulching materials (polythene, rice straw and chemical) on weed infestation, soil temperature, soil moisture and pod yield were studied. Polythene and straw mulch were effective in suppressing the weed infestation. Different mulching materials showed different effects on soil temperature. Polythene mulch increased the soil temperature by about 6 °C at 5 cm depth and by 4 °C at 10 cm depth. Mulches prevent soil water evaporation retaining soil moisture. Groundnut plants in polythene and straw mulched plots were generally tall, vigorous and reached early flowering. Use of straw as mulch provides an attractive and an environment friendly option in Vietnam, as it is one of the largest rice growing countries with the least use of rice straw. Besides, it recycles plant nutrients effectively.},

  abstract = {Horticulture makes intensive use of soil and extensive use of polyethylene (PE) sheeting and pesticides, producing an environment where the dynamics between soil and plastics can affect pesticide fate. We have determined that the presence of plastic residues in the horticultural soil of small production units equals 10\% of the soil area, being meso and macro-sections the predominant fragment sizes. All soil samples were taken from different plots located in Cuartel V, Moreno district, in the suburbs of Buenos Aires city, Argentina. Laboratory experiments were conducted to see the relations among pesticide, soil and PE film. Endosulfan recovery from LDPE films (25 μm and 100 μm) was studied, observing evidence that indicated migration to the inside of the plastic matrix. To further analyze the dynamics of pesticide migration to soil and atmosphere, experiments using chlorpyrifos, procymidone and trifluralin were performed in soil–plastic–atmosphere microenvironments, showing that up to 24 h significant amounts of pesticides moved away from the PE film. To determine whether PE residues could act as potential pesticide collector in soil, column elution experiments were done using chlorpyrifos, procymidone and trifluralin. Results showed an important pesticide accumulation in the mulch film (584 μg–2284 μg pesticide/g plastic) compared to soil (13 μg–32 μg pesticide/g soil). Finally, chemical and photochemical degradation of deltamethrin adsorbed in PE film was studied, finding a protective effect on hydrolysis but no protective effect on photodegradation. We believe that a deeper understanding of the dynamics among soil, plastic and pesticides in horticultural productive systems may contribute to alert for the implications of PE use for plastic sheeting.},

After the 96 h mixture, the sorption percentages of pharmaceuticals on PE microplastics decreased according to the following order: SER (28.61\%) {$>$} PRP (21.61\%) {$>$} SMX (15.31\%). The sorption kinetics were fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model. Both linear and Freundlich models were able to describe the sorption isotherm. The results suggest that the sorption process of the pharmaceuticals may be adequately described by their hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions. The desorption results showed that 8\% and 4\% of PRP and SER, respectively, were released from the microplastics within 48 h, but the sorption of SMX was irreversible. The results indicate the potential risks of PRP and SER for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms via ingestion of the microplastics in aquatic environments.},

This chapter focuses on the strengths and weakness of the LCA approach to biodegradable plastic in agriculture, thorough the description of main issues emerged from an extensive literature search and key case studies. In particular, studies which apply LCA on biodegradable mulching films and nursery pots are presented and discussed. Results of the study are somehow controversial. Despite the fact that LCA is the most systematic way to understand the interrelation between a product and the environment (including biodegradable products), some specific issues, related to the own nature of biodegradable products, require a more detailed way to be properly addressed. In particular crucial issues are related to the modelling of realistic waste management scenarios, the development of more appropriate impact categories (e.g. effects of littering) and the assessment of biorefineries which represent the only non-fossil carbon source for bio-based plastic materials.},

It increases people’s collective action tendencies, and is important for fostering environmental behavioral change beyond self-efficacy beliefs. The current study addresses two primary goals. First, we tested whether the difficulty of a task increased collective efficacy, and thereby environmental intentions. Second, we explored how collective and self-efficacy in concert predict such intentions. In a combined field-and-survey study, 165 voluntary participants took part in a plastic reduction challenge that was pretested as easy, moderate, or difficult. After being confronted with the task, participants completed an online questionnaire in which, among other variables, specific and general self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and pro-environmental intentions were measured—both general and plastic-reduction specific. Results revealed that (a) collective efficacy was significantly stronger when task difficulty was moderate rather than easy or difficult; and (b) that through specific collective and self-efficacy perceptions, sustainable intentions were gauged—even when controlling for attitudes and social norms. These findings suggest that collective efficacy beliefs are particularly relevant for attaining environmental goals that are neither too easy nor too difficult, and could thus be valuable for communication and policy strategies.},

  abstract = {Maintenance and improvement of soil quality in continuous cropping systems is critical to sustaining agricultural productivity and environmental quality for future generations. This review focuses on lessons learned from long-term continuous cropping experiments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the most often reported attribute from long-term studies and is chosen as the most important indicator of soil quality and agronomic sustainability because of its impact on other physical, chemical and biological indicators of soil quality. Long-term studies have consistently shown the benefit of manures, adequate fertilization, and crop rotation on maintaining agronomic productivity by increasing C inputs into the soil. However, even with crop rotation and manure additions, continuous cropping results in a decline in SOC, although the rate and magnitude of the decline is affected by cropping and tillage system, climate and soil. In the oldest of these studies, the influence of tillage on SOC and dependent soil quality indicators can only be inferred from rotation treatments which included ley rotations (with their reduced frequency of tillage). The impact of tillage per se on SOC and soil quality has only been tested in the ‘long-term’ for about 30 yrs, since the advent of conservation tillage techniques, and only in developed countries in temperate regions. Long-term conservation tillage studies have shown that, within climatic limits: Conservation tillage can sustain or actually increase SOC when coupled with intensive cropping systems; and the need for sound rotation practices in order to maintain agronomic productivity and economic sustainability is more critical in conservation tillage systems than conventional tillage systems. Long-term tillage studies are in their infancy. Preserving and improving these valuable resources is critical to our development of soil management practices for sustaining soil quality in continuous cropping systems.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is a potentially important source of microplastic (MP) entering aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known regarding the erosion and transport processes of MP from agricultural topsoils. The aim of this study is to analyze the erosion and transport behavior of MP during heavy rainfall events, whereas a specific focus is set to preferential MP transport and MP-soil interactions potentially leading to a more conservative transport behavior. The study is based on a series of rainfall simulations on paired-plots (4.5 m × 1.6 m) of silty loam and loamy sand located in Southern Germany. The simulations (rainfall intensity 60 mm h−1) were repeated 3 times within 1.5 years. An amount of 10 g m−2 of fine (MPf, size 53–100 μm) and 50 g m−2 of coarse (MPc, size 250–300 μm) high-density polyethylene as common polymer was added to the topsoil ({$<$}10 cm) of the plots. The experiments show a preferential erosion and transport of the MP leading to a mean enrichment ratio of 3.95 ± 3.71 (MPc) and 3.17 ± 2.58 (MPf) in the eroded sediment. There was a higher MP enrichment on the loamy sand but a higher sediment delivery on the silty loam resulting in nearly equal MP deliveries from both soil types. An increasing interaction with mineral soil particles or aggregates leads to a decreasing MP delivery over time. Within 1.5 years, up to 64\% of the eroded MP particles were bound to soil particles. Overall, more of the MPc was laterally lost via soil erosion, while for the MPf the vertical transport below the plough layer was more important. In general, our study indicates that arable land susceptible to soil erosion can be a substantial MP source for aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Micro-, submicro- and nanoplastic particles are increasingly regarded as vectors for trace organic chemicals. In order to determine adsorbed trace organic chemicals on polymers, it has usually been necessary to carry out complex extraction steps. With the help of a newly designed thermal desorption pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-Pyr-GC/MS) method, it is possible to identify adsorbed trace organic chemicals on micro-, submicro- and nanoparticles as well as the particle short chain polymers in one analytical setup without any transfers. This ensures a high sample throughput for the qualitative analysis of trace substances and polymer type. Since the measuring time per sample is only 2 h, a high sample throughput is possible. It is one of the few analytical methods which can be used also for the investigation of nanoplastic particles. Initially adsorbed substances are desorbed from the particle by thermal desorption (TD); subsequently, the polymer is fragmented by pyrolysis (PYR). Both particle treatment techniques are directly coupled with the same GC-MS system analyzing desorbed molecules and pyrolysis products, respectively. In this study, we developed a systematic and optimized method for this application. For method development, the trace organic chemicals phenanthrene, \&alpha;-cypermethrin and triclosan were tested on reference polymers polystyrene (PS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene (PE). Well-defined particle fractions were used, including polystyrene (sub)micro- (41 and 40 \&micro;m) and nanoparticles (78 nm) as well as 48-\&micro;m sized PE and PMMA particles, respectively. The sorption of phenanthrene (PMMA \&lt;\&lt; PS 40 \&micro;m \&lt; 41 \&micro;m \&lt; PE \&lt; PS 78 nm) and \&alpha;-cypermethrin (PS 41 \&micro;m \&lt; PS 40 \&micro;m \&lt; PE \&lt; PMMA \&lt; PS 78 nm) to the particles was strongly polymer-dependent.

  abstract = {Several studies have shown multiple confounding factors influencing soil respiration in the field, which often hampers a correct separation and interpretation of the different environmental effects on respiration. Here, we present a controlled laboratory experiment on undisturbed organic and mineral soil cores separating the effects of temperature, drying–rewetting and decomposition dynamics on soil respiration. Specifically, we address the following questions:  * 1Is the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10) dependent on soil moisture or soil organic matter age (incubation time) and does it differ for organic and mineral soil as suggested by recent field studies. * 2How much do organic and mineral soil layers contribute to total soil respiration? * 3Is there potential to improve soil flux models of soil introducing a multilayer source model for soil respiration? Eight organic soil and eight mineral soil cores were taken from a Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand in southern Germany, and incubated for 90 days in a climate chamber with a diurnal temperature regime between 7 and 23°C. Half of the samples were rewetted daily, while the other half were left to dry and rewetted thereafter. Soil respiration was measured with a continuously operating open dynamic soil respiration chamber system. The Q10 was stable at around 2.7, independent of soil horizon and incubation time, decreasing only slightly when the soil dried. We suggest that recent findings of the Q10 dependency on several factors are emergent properties at the ecosystem level, that should be analysed further e.g. with regard to rhizosphere effects. Most of the soil CO2 efflux was released from the organic samples. Initially, it averaged 4.0~μmol~m−2~s−1 and declined to 1.8~μmol~m−2~s−1 at the end of the experiment. In terms of the third question, we show that models using only one temperature as predictor of soil respiration fail to explain more than 80\% of the diurnal variability, are biased with a hysteresis effect, and slightly underestimate the temperature sensitivity of respiration. In contrast, consistently more than 95\% of the diurnal variability is explained by a dual-source model, with one CO2 source related to the surface temperature and another CO2 source related to the central temperature, highlighting the role of soil surface processes for ecosystem carbon balances.},

  abstract = {Agricultural mulch film (AMF) is deemed an important source of microplastics (MPs) in agricultural soil (AS). However, quantitating the contribution of AMFs to MPs in farmland soil and surface water remains a considerable challenge to date. In the present study, a basic framework was developed to address these concerns. First, the concentrations of MPs in soil derived from AMF abrasion (CMP) and the total MPs from all sources in AS (CTMP) were measured. Then, the ratios of CMP to CTMP, i.e., the contribution of AMFs to MPs in AS, were calculated. The contribution of AMFs to MPs in surface water via soil erosion was calculated based on CTMP values, the ratios of CMP to CTMP, soil erosion intensities (SEIs), and farmland areas. Furthermore, the potential contribution of soil erosion to MPs in the ocean was estimated. In China, the inventory of MPs in surface AS in 2018 ranged from 4.9~×~106 to 1.0~×~107 tons according to our results. AMFs contributed 10\%–30\% of the CTMP with certainties of 60–95\%. Assuming that all MPs in AS can be exhaustively transferred to surface water via soil erosion, the national mass transfer amount of MPs (MTTMP) from AS to surface water reached 1.2~×~105−2.2~×~105 tons (∼2\% of the inventory of MPs in the AS of China); the fluxes of MPs into the ocean from AS were 3.4~×~104−6.6~×~104 tons, assuming that all MPs in the AS of coastal provinces enter the ocean. It is likely that AMFs contributed 10\%–30\% MTTMP and fluxes of MPs to the ocean according to the ratios of CMP to CTMP. Apparently, approximately 30\% of the national MTTMP (i.e., the rate of MP flux to the ocean to MTTMP) was input to the ocean.},

  abstract = {Agricultural plastic film (APF) is widely used in modern agriculture. Under natural environmental conditions, the structure, surface properties and mechanical properties of APFs change because of sunlight, wind and other factors and gradually break into debris, resulting in the generation of microplastics (MPs). Studies have reported that the MPs concentration in soil is positively correlated with the use intensity and duration of APFs. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no method to measure the emissions of in situ APFs has been developed. In this study, the effects of mechanical abrasion driven by wind on MPs fragmentation by polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) APFs with the increase of exposure time were investigated. Meanwhile, based on the release rate model of PS fragmented MPs under natural sunlight, a modified model to quantify the effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure duration on the production of APF fragmented MPs was developed. Based on these models, the amount of MPs produced from APFs in farmland in China was estimated. The national annual MPs mass emissions from APFs in agricultural soil were approximately 5~×~104 to 6.8~×~104~tons in 2018 due to wind and 6.5~×~103~tons due to sunlight, and the total emission level due to both wind and sunlight was 5.1~×~104 to 7.0~×~104~tons. Compared with that of wind, the contribution of UV radiation to MPs emission is smaller. Our estimates are comparable to data reported in previous studies, indicating that our models have good practical applications and are of great significance for predicting MPs production from APFs in farmland.},

Once released into the terrestrial environment, microplastics can be aged via photo- and thermally-initiated oxidative degradation, hetero-aggregation, and bioturbation. Aging affects the physiochemical properties of microplastics with the increase of surface roughness and oxygen-containing groups, which could enhance the sorption and mobility of microplastics in the soil and groundwater environment. However, the interactions among aging, sorption, and transport of microplastics in the terrestrial system have not been unveiled. This review clarifies the key processes of microplastics transport pathways in soil and groundwater ecosystems influenced by aging and sorption under various scenarios. Co-transport of microplastics and sorbed contaminants are also addressed to help understand the risks associated with heavy metals, organic contaminants, and engineered nanoparticles in the soil environment.

  abstract = {Since 2004, when microplastics appears in literature, thousands of researchers focussed on this topic and analysed microplastics in almost every environmental compartment. However, there is still a lack of standardisation, and therefore, used methodologies varied widely. Most researchers performed controversially discussed visual examination, but it became more and more a supporting tool to reduce measuring effort. To that account, especially infrared or Raman microscopy were used for chemical characterisation. This indicates that dimensions of analysed microplastics changed to micrometre scaling. However, those microscopy technologies were used for particle by particle characterisation, and therefore, it is still challenging to handle the mass of data. Alternatively, thermal extraction and desorption gas chromatography is a useful integrating analysis approach, which allows a multicomponent characterisation of environmental samples without any complex sample preparation.},

  abstract = {Characterising microplastics based on spectroscopic measurements is one key step of many studies that analyse the fate of microplastics in the environment. Over the years, many potential sources of error were identified, which can be seen by the implementation of anti-contamination protocols, measuring laboratory blanks or using less aggressive chemicals for sample purification. However, the identification process itself in the meaning of a traceable and transparent documentation is hard to find in many research studies. Unfortunately, this can make it difficult to estimate if the presented results are representative and reproducible, as the evaluation process during microplastics identification depends dramatically on the performed data treatment. To increase the awareness of this often neglected topic, this article reviews suitable data preprocessing and evaluation methods for microplastics identification based on spectroscopic measurements and will recommend a practical workflow or check list that can easily be used for further research studies.},

  abstract = {One key step studying interactions of microplastics with our ecological system is to identify plastics within environmental samples. Aging processes and surface contamination especially with biofilms impede this characterization. A complex and time-consuming cleaning procedure is a common solution for this problem. However, it implies an artificial change of sample composition with a risk of losing important information or even damaging microplastic particles. In the present work, we introduce a new chemometric approach to identify heavily weathered and contaminated microplastics without any cleaning. The main idea of this concept is based on an automated curve fitting of most relevant vibrational bands to calculate a highly characteristic fingerprint that contains all vibrational band area ratios. This new data set will be used to estimate the similarity of samples and reference standards for identification. A total of 300 individual naturally weathered plastic particles were measured with Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection mode (FT-IR ATR) and identified successfully with the new method. To that end, all samples were compared with a selection of common reference plastics and bio polymers. As it turns out, the accuracy of identification rises significantly from 76\% by means of conventional library searching algorithms to 96\% by identifying microplastics with our new method. Therefore, the new approach can be a useful tool to compare and describe similarities of FT-IR spectra of microplastics, which may improve further research studies on this topic.},

  abstract = {Polymeric materials flowing through the technosphere are repositories of organic chemicals throughout their life cycle. Equilibrium partition ratios of organic chemicals between these materials and air (KMA) or water (KMW) are required for models of fate and transport, high-throughput exposure assessment and passive sampling. KMA and KMW have been measured for a growing number of chemical/material combinations, but significant data gaps still exist. We assembled a database of 363 KMA and 910 KMW measurements for 446 individual compounds and nearly 40 individual polymers and biopolymers, collected from 29 studies. We used the EPI Suite and ABSOLV software packages to estimate physicochemical properties of the compounds and we employed an empirical correlation based on Trouton's rule to adjust the measured KMA and KMW values to a standard reference temperature of 298 K. Then, we used a thermodynamic triangle with Henry's law constant to calculate a complete set of 1273 KMA and KMW values. Using simple linear regression, we developed a suite of single parameter linear free energy relationship (spLFER) models to estimate KMA from the EPI Suite-estimated octanol–air partition ratio (KOA) and KMW from the EPI Suite-estimated octanol–water (KOW) partition ratio. Similarly, using multiple linear regression, we developed a set of polyparameter linear free energy relationship (ppLFER) models to estimate KMA and KMW from ABSOLV-estimated Abraham solvation parameters. We explored the two LFER approaches to investigate (1) their performance in estimating partition ratios, and (2) uncertainties associated with treating all different polymers as a single “bulk” polymeric material compartment. The models we have developed are suitable for screening assessments of the tendency for organic chemicals to be emitted from materials, and for use in multimedia models of the fate of organic chemicals in the indoor environment. In screening applications we recommend that KMA and KMW be modeled as 0.06 × KOA and 0.06 × KOW respectively, with an uncertainty range of a factor of 15.},

  abstract = {The ability of microorganisms to use polyethylene as a carbon source has only been recently established. This result has significance both from an environmental point of view, due to the accumulation of millions of tons of waste plastics every year, but also regarding the conservation of integrity for infrastructures incorporating this plastic. A number of microorganisms with the ability to grow on polyethylene have been isolated. The effects of these microorganisms on the physiochemical properties of this polymer have been described; these include changes in crystallinity, molecular weight, topography of samples and the functional groups found on the surface. Although the bio-degradation and bio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several researchers, the enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these phenomena are still unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both enzymatic and abiotic factors (such UV light) can mediate the initial oxidation of polyethylene chains, and given the chemical similarity between polyethylene and olefins it has been suggested that the metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be used once the size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range for enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons). The long-range structure and morphology of polyethylene have shown important roles, with amorphous regions being more prone to microbial attack than crystalline ones. This review focuses on the recent hypotheses and experimental findings regarding the biodegradation of polyethylene.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution in the environment is a growing concern in today's world. Wind-eroded sediment, as an environmental transport pathway of microplastics, can result in environmental and human exposure far beyond its sources. For the first time, this study investigates the presence of microplastics in wind-eroded sediments from different land uses in the Fars Province, Iran. Eleven test plots were selected based on land use and wind erosion risk. On each plot, wind erosion was simulated using a portable wind tunnel and the eroded sediment was collected for further analysis aimed at measuring light density microplastics (LDMP). The LDMPs were extracted in both soil and wind-eroded sediment using a floatation method and then further examined using microscopy. Annual LDMP transport by wind erosion was estimated using wind data from the study areas. LDMPs were detected in six study areas in the Fars Province which are highly prone to wind erosion. Although LDMPs were found mostly in agricultural land, it was also detected in the soils and sediments from two natural areas. The total concentrations of LDMPs in polluted areas were 6.91 and 20.27 mg kg−1 of microplastics in soil and wind-eroded sediments, respectively. The enrichment ratio for LDMP ranged from 2.83 to 7.63 in different areas. The erosion rate of LDMP ranged from 0.08 to 1.48 mg m−2 min−1. The results of this study confirmed the key role of wind erosion in the spread of microplastics in terrestrial environments which could form an exposure risk to humans via direct inhalation of the particles transported with the dust.},

One of the best solutions is replacing the fossil-based plastics with bioplastics. Bioplastics such as polylactic acid (PLA) are biodegradable materials with less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. PLA is a biopolymer produced from natural resources with good mechanical and chemical properties, therefore, it is used widely in packaging, agriculture, and biomedical industries. PLA products mostly end up in landfills or composting. In this review paper, the existing life cycle assessments (LCA) for PLA were comprehensively reviewed and classified. According to the LCAs, the energy and materials used in the whole life cycle of PLA were reported. Finally, the GHG emissions of PLA in each stage of its life cycle, including feedstock acquisition and conversion, manufacturing of PLA products, the PLA applications, and the end of life (EoL) options, were described. The most energy-intensive stage in the life cycle of PLA is its conversion. By optimizing the conversion process of PLA, it is possible to make it a low-carbon material with less dependence on energy sources.},

  abstract = {A review is presented of the manufacture and use of different types of plastic, and the effects of pollution by these materials on animal, human and environmental health, insofar as this is known. Since 2004, the world has made as much plastic as it did in the previous half century, and it has been reckoned that the total mass of virgin plastics ever made amounts to 8.3 billion tonnes, mainly derived from natural gas and crude oil, used as chemical feedstocks and fuel sources. Between 1950 and 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tonnes of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste was generated, of which around 9\% has been recycled, and 12\% incinerated, with the remaining 79\% either being stored in landfills or having been released directly into the natural environment. In 2015, 407 million tonnes (Mt) of plastic was produced, of which 164 Mt was consumed by packaging (36\% of the total). Although quoted values vary, packaging probably accounts for around one third of all plastics used, of which approximately 40\% goes to landfill, while 32\% escapes the collection system. It has been deduced that around 9 Mt of plastic entered the oceans in 2010, as a result of mismanaged waste, along with up to 0.5 Mt each of microplastics from washing synthetic textiles, and from the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces. However, the amount of plastics actually measured in the oceans represents less than 1\% of the (at least) 150 Mt reckoned to have been released into the oceans over time. Plastic accounts for around 10\% by mass of municipal waste, but up to 85\% of marine debris items – most of which arrive from land-based sources. Geographically, the five heaviest plastic polluters are P.R. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which between them contribute 56\% of global plastic waste. Larger, primary plastic items can undergo progressive fragmentation to yield a greater number of increasingly smaller ‘secondary’ microplastic particles, thus increasing the overall surface area of the plastic material, which enhances its ability to absorb, and concentrate, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with the potential to transfer them to the tissues of animals that ingest the microplastic particles, particularly in marine environments., Although fears that such microparticles and their toxins may be passed via food webs to humans are not as yet substantiated, the direct ingestion of microplastics by humans via drinking water is a distinct possibility – since 92\% of samples taken in the USA and 72\% in Europe showed their presence – although any consequent health effects are as yet unclear. Foodstuffs may also become contaminated by microplastics from the air, although any consequent health effects are also unknown. In regard to such airborne sources, it is noteworthy that small plastic particles have been found in human lung tissue, which might prove an adverse health issue under given circumstances. It is also very striking that microplastics have been detected in mountain soils in Switzerland, which are most likely windborne in origin. Arctic ice core samples too have revealed the presence of microplastics, which were most likely carried on ocean currents from the Pacific garbage patch, and from local pollution from shipping and fishing. Thus, sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean, but these particles will be released into the global environment when the ice melts, particularly under the influence of a rising mean global temperature., While there is a growing emphasis toward the substitution of petrochemically derived plastics by bioplastics, controversy has arisen in regard to how biodegradable the latter actually are in the open environment, and they presently only account for 0.5\% of the total mass of plastics manufactured globally. Since the majority of bioplastics are made from sugar and starch materials, to expand their use significantly raises the prospect of competition between growing crops to supply food or plastics, similarly to the diversion of food crops for the manufacture of primary biofuels. The use of oxo-plastics, which contain additives that assist the material to degrade, is also a matter of concern, since it is claimed that they merely fragment and add to the environmental burden of microplastics; hence, the European Union has moved to restrict their use., Since 6\% of the current global oil (including natural gas liquids, NGLs) production is used to manufacture plastic commodities – predicted to rise to 20\% by 2050 – the current approaches for the manufacture and use of plastics (including their end-use) demand immediate revision. More extensive collection and recycling of plastic items at the end of their life, for re-use in new production, to offset the use of virgin plastic, is a critical aspect both for reducing the amount of plastic waste entering the environment, and in improving the efficiency of fossil resource use. This is central to the ideology underpinning the circular economy, which has common elements with permaculture, the latter being a regenerative design system based on ‘nature as teacher’, which could help optimise the use of resources in town and city environments, while minimising and repurposing ‘waste’. Thus, food might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller inputs of fuels (including transportation fuels for importing and distributing food), water and fertilisers, and with a marked reduction in the use of plastic packaging. Such an approach, adopted by billions of individuals, could prove of immense significance in ensuring future food security, and in reducing waste and pollution – of all kinds.},

Copper, applied in the form of copper hydroxide, is the most widely used fungicide–bactericide for control of tomato diseases and recently has been detected in the Chesapeake Bay (USA) watershed. Elevated levels of copper have been shown to have adverse effects on shellfish, finfish, and other aquatic organisms. This research evaluates the off-site movement of copper with the dissolved phase and the particulate phase of runoff from controlled field plots containing tomato plants grown in either polyethylene mulch or a vegetative mulch, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.). Overall, runoff collected from polyethylene mulch plots contained significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater loads of dissolved- and particulate-phase copper than runoff from hairy vetch mulch plots. However, the loss of copper associated with the particulate phase was significantly greater (p ≤ 0.05) than that associated with the dissolved phase of runoff from both mulch treatments, with the particulate phase accounting for more than 80\% of the copper loads. The reported toxicity of copper to aquatic organisms and the greater runoff volume, soil loss, and off-site loading of copper measured in runoff from the polyethylene mulch suggests that this management practice is less sustainable and may have a more harmful impact on aquatic ecosystems.},

Evaluations were conducted using measured pesticide concentrations in runoff at the edge-of-field and estimated environmental concentrations in an adjacent creek and a theoretical pond receiving the runoff. Runoff from Poly-Bare presented the greatest risk to ecosystem health and to sensitive organisms, whereas the use of Vetch minimized these risks. Previous studies have shown that harvest yields were maintained and that runoff volume, soil loss, and off-site transport of pesticides measured in runoff were reduced using the alternative management practices (Poly-Rye and Vetch). Together, these results indicate that the alternative management practices (Poly-Rye and Vetch) have a less adverse impact on the environment than the conventional management practice (PolyBare) while providing growers with an acceptable economic return. In addition, the present study demonstrates the need to consider the management practice when assessing the potential risks and hazards for certain pesticides.},

During rain events, runoff from vegetable production is enhanced because 50 to 75\% of the field is covered with an impervious surface. This study was conducted to quantify off-site movement of soil and pesticides with runoff from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plots containing polyethylene mulch and a vegetative mulch, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth). Side-by-side field plots were instrumented with automated flow meters and samplers to measure and collect runoff, which was filtered, extracted, and analyzed to determine soil and pesticide loss. Seasonal losses of two to four times more water and at least three times as much sediment were observed from plots with polyethylene mulch (55.4 to 146 L m(-2) and 247 to 535 g m(-2), respectively) versus plots with hairy vetch residue (13.7 to 75.7 L m(-2) and 32.8 to 118 g m(-2), respectively).

Tree plantations are advocated as a C sink, however, little is known about rates of C turnover and sequestration into soil organic matter under subtropical and tropical tree plantations. We studied changes in SOC in a chronosequence of hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantations established on former rainforest sites in seasonally dry subtropical Australia. SOC, δ13C, and light fraction organic C (LF C\&lt;1.6 g cm−3) were determined in plantations, secondary rainforest and pasture. We calculated loss of rainforest SOC after clearing for pasture using an isotope mixing model, and used the decay rate of rainforest-derived C to predict input of hoop pine-derived C into the soil. Total SOC stocks to 100 cm depth were significantly (P\&lt;0.01) higher under rainforest (241 t ha−1) and pasture (254 t ha−1) compared to hoop pine (176–211 t ha−1). We calculated that SOC derived from hoop pine inputs ranged from 32\% (25 year plantation) to 61\% (63 year plantation) of total SOC in the 0–30 cm soil layer, but below 30 cm all C originated from rainforest. These results were compared to simulations made by the Century soil organic matter model. The Century model simulations showed that lower C stocks under hoop pine plantations were due to reduced C inputs to the slow turnover C pool, such that this pool only recovers to within 45\% of the original rainforest C pool after 63 years. This may indicate differences in soil C stabilization mechanisms under hoop pine plantations compared with rainforest and pasture. These results demonstrate that subtropical hoop pine plantations do not rapidly sequester SOC into long-term storage pools, and that alternative plantation systems may need to be investigated to achieve greater soil C sequestration.},

Microplastics may also have evolutionary consequences for soil microbes, because the particles may alter conditions in the soil and hence selection pressures. Including an evolutionary perspective in an environmental assessment of microplastics could lead to new questions and novel insights into responses of soil microbes to this anthropogenic stressor. Abstract Microplastic pollution is increasingly considered to be a factor of global change: in addition to aquatic ecosystems, this persistent contaminant is also found in terrestrial systems and soils. Microplastics have been chiefly examined in soils in terms of the presence and potential effects on soil biota. Given the persistence and widespread distribution of microplastics, it is also important to consider potential evolutionary implications of the presence of microplastics in soil; we offer such a perspective for soil microbiota. We discuss the range of selection pressures likely to act upon soil microbes, highlight approaches for the study of evolutionary responses to microplastics, and present the obstacles to be overcome. Pondering the evolutionary consequences of microplastics in soils can yield new insights into the effects of this group of pollutants, including establishing ‘true’ baselines in soil ecology, and understanding future responses of soil microbial populations and communities.},

Microplastic has been extensively studied in aquatic environments, with very few studies focusing on soils. We here tested the idea that microplastic particles (polyethylene beads) could be transported from the soil surface down the soil profile via earthworms. We used Lumbricus terrestris L., an anecic earthworm species, in a factorial greenhouse experiment with four different microplastic sizes. Presence of earthworms greatly increased the presence of microplastic particles at depth (we examined 3 soil layers, each 3.5\,cm deep), with smaller PE microbeads having been transported downward to a greater extent. Our study clearly shows that earthworms can be significant transport agents of microplastics in soils, incorporating this material into soil, likely via casts, burrows (affecting soil hydraulics), egestion and adherence to the earthworm exterior. This movement has potential consequences for exposure of other soil biota to microplastics, for the residence times of microplastic at greater depth, and for the possible eventual arrival of microplastics in the groundwater.},

Few studies on microplastic effects on soil biota are available, and no study in a microplastic contamination context has specifically addressed soil protists. Soil protists, a phylogenetically and functionally diverse group of eukaryotic, unicellular soil organisms, are major consumers of bacteria in soils and are potentially important vehicles for the delivery of microplastics into the soil food chain. Here we build a case for focusing research on soil protists by drawing on data from previous, older studies of phagocytosis in protist taxa, which have long made use of polystyrene latex beads (microspheres). Various soil-borne taxa, including ciliates, flagellates and amoebae take up microplastic beads in the size range of a few micrometers. This included filter feeders as well as amoebae which engulf their prey. Discrimination in microplastic particle uptake depended on species, physiological state as well as particle size. Based on the results of the studies we review here, there is now a need to study microplastic effects in a pollution ecology context: this means considering a broad range of particle types under realistic conditions in the soil, and exploring longer-term effects on soil protist communities and functions.},

MPs can affect the carbon cycle in numerous ways, for example, by being carbon themselves and by influencing soil microbial processes, plant growth, or litter decomposition. Great uncertainty surrounds nano-sized plastic particles, an expected by-product of further fragmentation of MPs. A major concerted effort is required to understand the pervasive effects of MPs on the functioning of soils and terrestrial ecosystems; importantly, such research needs to capture the immense diversity of these particles in terms of chemistry, aging, size, and shape.},

Further degradation and fragmentation, resulting in the formation of nanosized plastic particles – nanoplastics – has been highlighted as a potentially important issue. In the environment, both microplastics and nanoplastics may have direct ecotoxicological effects, as well as vector effects through the adsorption of co-contaminants. Plastic additives and monomers may also be released from the polymer matrix and cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Although limited information regarding the ecotoxicological effects of nano- and microplastics is available at present, their small size gives rise to concern with respect to the adverse effects and dislocation of these particles inside organisms – similar to issues often discussed for engineered nanomaterials. In the same way, transport of co-contaminants and leaching of soluble substances are much debated issues with respect to the ecotoxicology of nanomaterials.In this chapter, we draw on existing knowledge from the field of ecotoxicology of engineered nanomaterials to discuss potential ecotoxicological effects of nano- and microplastics. We discuss the similarities and differences between nano- and microplastics and engineered nanomaterials with regard to both potential effects and expected behaviour in aquatic media. One of the key challenges in ecotoxicology of nanomaterials has been the applicability of current test methods, originally intended for soluble chemicals, to the testing of particle suspensions. This often requires test modifications and special attention to physical chemical characterisation and data interpretation. We present an overview of lessons learned from nanomaterials and offer suggestions on how these can be transferred to recommendations for ecotoxicity testing of nano- and microplastics.},

An automatic soil water station (ASWS) was used to monitor soil water content and potential in the two cultivation systems. The ASWS data indicated that most of the water bypassed the potatoes planted in ridges as irrigation water applied to the crop from a boom irrigator was shed off the ridges infiltrating in the furrows. This was due to the water repellent nature of the sandy soil and meant that the irrigation water bypassed the potatoes. A soil water deficit built up in the core of the ridge as the crop grew and was not replenished by irrigations. A second early potato crop planted in beds was more successful at capturing water as the flat bed increased water infiltration around the crop. This has major implications for cultivation practice, scab control and crop water management. Instruments measuring soil water potential, content, temperature and rainfall were connected to a data logger powered by a solar panel and proved a successful way of monitoring infiltration. Hourly data was collected so that a high temporal resolution data set could be constructed in order to increase conceptual understanding of hydrological processes at a scale appropriate to the crop.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of plastics in aquatic systems constitutes an emerging scientific and societal concern, because of their ubiquity, high persistence and insufficient management by sewage and wastewater treatment processes. Microplastics ({$<$}5 mm), a group of particles differing in physico-chemical properties (e.g. size, shape, colour, density and polymer type), are of particular concern as they can reach high densities and can interact with biotic and abiotic environment. Moreover, potential of bioaccumulation increases with decreasing of particle size. Although microplastics have been widely investigated in marine systems, very little attention is paid to freshwater systems. As the concern about microplastics started appearing recently, there is no unified method for microplastic isolation, which result in inconsistent data that differs in quality and resolution. Hence, this work aims to assess the effectiveness of distinct isolation methods as an attempt to identify and establish a unified method for environmental monitoring of aquatic systems. For that, artificial samples containing eleven plastics belonging to the most common types of polymers (e.g. low/high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate) were prepared and subjected to different methods, including density separation methods using sugar, olive oil and zinc chloride, as well as organic matter degradation methods with hydrogen peroxide (wet peroxide oxidation) and multienzymatic detergent (enzymatic digestion). The samples then underwent the detection, quantification, and identification of polymers using a stereomicroscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Several criteria were considered in order to achieve the aims of this work: efficiency of density separation and organic matter degradation, the total mass of recovered polymers, cost of each procedure, the time spent with each method, the simplicity, and the quality of recovered polymers. Based on this multi-criteria approach, this study concludes that the wet peroxide oxidation with addition of zinc chloride was the most effective method.},

  abstract = {The methodology used to extract and quantify microplastics (MPs) in aquatic systems are still not standardized. Salt saturated solutions, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and/or sodium iodide (NaI), are normally added to separate dense plastics from aquatic samples. However, the most effective reagents are also the most expensive (e.g. ZnCl2 and NaI). To decrease this cost, a reuse process of the salt solutions should be applied. The reuse process has been widely investigated for the NaI solution neglecting the ZnCl2. Hence, the aim of this study was to present a simple methodology to reuse the ZnCl2 solution ensuring the efficiency of the product. Results of the present study showed that ZnCl2 solution could be reused at least five times maintaining an efficiency above 95 \%. •The ZnCl2 reuse decreases the cost of the methodology.•The efficiency of ZnCl2 solution after five filtrations remains above 95 \% (all polymers are detected and recovered).•The use of this salt solution is the most cost-effective methodology to isolate MPs from aquatic samples.},

  abstract = {Plastics have revolutionised our daily lives. Their versatility, low-cost of production, light weight and resistance justify their presence in a vast variety of products. In agriculture, plastics are mainly used to develop and maintain specific microclimate conditions needed for improving plant development. This technological revolution has allowed that infertile lands characterized by a drastic desertification process, adverse climatic conditions, or with a high pest pressure, be transformed in highly productive areas able to boost local/regional economic growth. Traditionally, soil physicochemical properties have been the primary endpoints to assess the impact of agricultural plastics on soil. However, the effects of plastic debris and microplastics on soil biota is gaining a growing concern. In this chapter, the authors discuss the current knowledge on the potential impact of microplastics on agricultural soils under a biological perspective. The first section describes the main applications of polymeric-based materials in agriculture, particularly horticulture, which may pose a significant source of plastic contamination. A second section summarises the main routes of plastic input in agricultural soil. The last section will discuss the main uncertainties regarding the occurrence of microplastics in the soil system, and what are the research areas that will require further investigation.},

To tackle the mechanisms of toxicity of these contaminants to soil invertebrates, earthworms (Eisenia fetida Savigny, 1826) were exposed during 28~days to different concentrations of low-density polyethylene microplastics (62, 125, 250, 500 and 1000~mg MPs kg−1 soildw) with sizes ranging between 250 and 1000~μm, in an artificial soil. The ecotoxicological responses were evaluated by analysing various oxidative stress biomarkers (catalase, glutathione S-transferase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), a biomarker of energy metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase) and overall organism molecular changes by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. Significant effects resulting from an unbalanced oxidative stress system, expressed in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels were recorded on earthworms exposed at the three highest concentrations tested. Despite that, no significant changes were recorded on the molecular profiles of earthworms by FTIR-ATR. NMR analysis pointed out for differences from the control, only for earthworms exposed to the lowest concentration of MPs. Considering that stress responses are complex, and involve multiple mechanisms, a cluster analysis taking into account all the parameters assessed, clearly identified two groups of earthworms separated by the concentration of 250~mg MPs kg−1 soildw, above each meaningful effects were recorded.},

Here we introduce an alternative workflow for identification and mass quantitation through a combination of optical microscopy with image analysis (IA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We studied four synthetic polymers with environmental concern: low and high density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE, respectively), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Selected experiments were conducted to investigate (i) particle characterization and counting procedures based on image analysis with open-source software, (ii) chemical identification of microplastics based on DSC signal processing, (iii) dependence of particle size on DSC signal, and (iv) quantitation of microplastics mass based on DSC signal. We describe the potential and limitations of these techniques to increase reliability for microplastic analysis. Particle size demonstrated to have particular incidence in the qualitative and quantitative performance of DSC signals. Both, identification (based on characteristic onset temperature) and mass quantitation (based on heat flow) showed to be affected by particle size. As a result, a proper sample treatment which includes sieving of suspended particles is particularly required for this analytical approach.},

The thermal treatment comprised various temperatures (50°C, 60°C, and 70°C) and exposure times, and was characterized through a so-called Energy-Time Factor (the product of thermal energy and exposure time). Changes in viscosity, EB \%, and CI were correlated to this factor. A modified Mark-Houwink equation was used to relate the zero shear-rate viscosity and Mw of the degraded LDPE films. Results indicate that the EB \%, Mw and viscosity decrease simultaneously with an increase in the CI as the Energy-Time Factor augments, allowing the assessment of the variation of these properties with Mw. Calculations of the percentage abiotic degradation (\%D) of LDPE films indicate that a Mw of 6 kg mol−1 corresponds to a maximum abiotic degradation degree of 91.85\%, which is henceforth susceptible to biodegradation. The film treated with Energy-Time Factor of 2.79E+09 J s mol−1 reached a 74\% of biodegradation in 90 days (average time of the composting process).

The possible use of C. elegans as a sentinel organism in the monitoring of soil ecosystem health was also tested by conducting the experiment on the exposure of nematode to field soil. Twenty-four-hour median lethal concentration (LC50) data suggest that DEHP has a relatively high potential of acute toxicity to C. elegans. Decreases in body length and egg number per worm observed after 24 h of DEHP exposure may induce long-term alteration in the growth and reproduction of the nematode population. Based on the result from the C. elegans genome array and indicated in the literatures, stress proteins, metallothionein, vitellogenin, xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, apoptosis-related proteins, and antioxidant enzyme genes were selected as stress-related genes and their expression in C. elegans by DEHP exposure was analyzed semi-quantitatively. Expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-16.1 and hsp-16.2 genes was decreased by DEHP exposure. Expression of cytochrome P450 (cyp) 35a2 and glutathione-S-transferease (gst)-4, phase I and phase II of xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, was increased by DEHP exposure in a concentration-dependent manner. An increase in stress-related gene expressions occurred concomitantly with the deterioration on the physiological level, which suggests an increase in expression of those genes may not be considered as a homeostatic response but as a toxicity that might have physiological consequences. The experiment with the soil from the landfill site suggests that the potential of the C. elegans biomarker identified in laboratory conditions should be calibrated and validated for its use in situ.},

  abstract = {Soil fertility is closely linked to soil organic matter (SOM), whose status depends on input, i.e., mainly biomass management, and output, i.e., mineralization, erosion and leaching. Preliminary results from runoff plots and lysimeters on hillslopes in West Africa indicated that carbon losses by erosion and leaching ranged between 10 and 100 kg C ha−1 yr−1, depending on annual rainfall and vegetal cover. Under natural conditions, losses may be low enough to be compensated by aerial deposits. But together with mineralization, erosion can locally be an important cause of SOM decrease in cropping systems where there is poor soil cover, steep slopes and erosive rain conditions. The effect of previous erosion on cereal production was assessed in case studies from Rwanda, Burundi, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso. On the densely populated hillslopes of Rwanda, hedges and manure reduced runoff and erosion efficiently, but did not succeed in improving grain yields due to P-deficiency of these ferrallitic soils. In Burundi, under similar conditions but under banana plantation, tree density and mulch cover had a strong influence on erosion; this previous erosion had an important effect on the next maize yield, even when the soils were amended with manure, mineral fertilizers and lime. On sandy ferruginous soils of North Cameroon, erosion increased with increasing tillage intensity. Manure application increased grain yield, but burying organic residues did not improve SOM levels and soil resistance to erosion. Mulching and tillage limited to the plant rows protected the topsoil against erosion, but did not clearly increase the yield. Manuring permitted the restoration of soil productivity, but additional mineral fertilizers (P, N) were needed to reach rapidly a high level of grain production. In the same way, experiments conducted with traditional Zaï system for restoring a degraded Entisol in Burkina Faso showed that runoff harvesting and organic matter input were not sufficient with no additional N and P fertilizers. Complementary experiments in Cameroon showed that a 4-mm selective sheet erosion and a 50-mm non-selective de-surfacing resulted in similar yield decline. Long fallowing, burning and grazing are traditional ways to utilize available biomass in Africa. Considering social habits and technical realities, it seems useful to balance ‘grazing-manuring’ and mulching in order to protect the soil and maintain its productive capacity. Minimum tillage with mulch (crop residues, weeds or legume fallow) is the new trend used for increasing crop production, with the help of herbicides. Agroforestry that produces good-quality litter is also a part of the solution.},

  abstract = {The metabolism of phthalic acid (PA) and di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) in sludge-amended agricultural soil was studied with radiotracer techniques. The initial rates of metabolism of PA and DEHP (4.1 nmol/g [dry weight]) were estimated to be 731.8 and 25.6 pmol/g (dry weight) per day, respectively. Indigenous microorganisms assimilated 28 and 17\% of the carbon in [14C]PA and [14C]DEHP, respectively, into microbial biomass. The rates of DEHP metabolism were much greater in sludge assays without soil than in assays with sludge-amended soil. Mineralization of [14C]DEHP to 14CO2 increased fourfold after inoculation of sludge and soil samples with DEHP-degrading strain SDE 2. The elevated mineralization potential was maintained for more than 27 days. Experiments performed with strain SDE 2 suggested that the bioavailability and mineralization of DEHP decreased substantially in the presence of soil and sludge components. The microorganisms metabolizing PA and DEHP in sludge and sludge-amended soil were characterized by substrate-specific radiolabelling, followed by analysis of 14C-labelled phospholipid ester-linked fatty acids (14C-PLFAs). This assay provided a radioactive fingerprint of the organisms actively metabolizing [14C]PA and [14C]DEHP. The14C-PLFA fingerprints showed that organisms with different PLFA compositions metabolized PA and DEHP in sludge-amended soil. In contrast, microorganisms with comparable 14C-PLFA fingerprints were found to dominate DEHP metabolism in sludge and sludge-amended soil. Our results suggested that indigenous sludge microorganisms dominated DEHP degradation in sludge-amended soil. Mineralization of DEHP and PA followed complex kinetics that could not be described by simple first-order equations. The initial mineralization activity was described by an exponential function; this was followed by a second phase that was described best by a fractional power function. In the initial phase, the half times for PA and DEHP in sludge-amended soil were 2 and 58 days, respectively. In the late phase of incubation, the apparent half times for PA and DEHP increased to 15 and 147 days, respectively. In the second phase (after more than 28 days), the half time for DEHP was 2.9 times longer in sludge-amended soil assays than in sludge assays without soil. Experiments with radiolabelled DEHP degraders suggested that a significant fraction of the 14CO2 produced in long-term degradation assays may have originated from turnover of labelled microbial biomass rather than mineralization of [14C]PA or [14C]DEHP. It was estimated that a significant amount of DEHP with poor biodegradability and extractability remains in sludge-amended soil for extended periods of time despite the presence of microorganisms capable of degrading the compound (e.g., more than 40\% of the DEHP added is not mineralized after 1 year).},

While serving many applications because of their durability, stability and low cost, plastics have deleterious effects on the environment. Plastic is known to release a variety of chemicals during degradation, which has a negative impact on biota. Here, we show that the most commonly used plastics produce two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene, when exposed to ambient solar radiation. Polyethylene, which is the most produced and discarded synthetic polymer globally, is the most prolific emitter of both gases. We demonstrate that the production of trace gases from virgin low-density polyethylene increase with time, with rates at the end of a 212-day incubation of 5.8 nmol g-1 d-1 of methane, 14.5 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethylene, 3.9 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethane and 9.7 nmol g-1 d-1 of propylene. Environmentally aged plastics incubated in water for at least 152 days also produced hydrocarbon gases. In addition, low-density polyethylene emits these gases when incubated in air at rates \textasciitilde 2 times and \textasciitilde 76 times higher than when incubated in water for methane and ethylene, respectively. Our results show that plastics represent a heretofore unrecognized source of climate-relevant trace gases that are expected to increase as more plastic is produced and accumulated in the environment.},

  abstract = {This study elucidates the environmental significance of standard laboratory experiments for pesticide degradability in soil. Simazine, chlortoluron and phthalic acid bis-(2-ethylhexyl) ester (plasticizer, formulation additive) were used as model substances. Standard metabolism experiments with 14C-labelled substances were performed in a biometer system with {$<$}2 mm-soil fractions (silty sand and silty loam, respectively) at constant soil moisture and 20°C. Another set of samples was incubated under simulated outdoor conditions (alternating temperature and soil moisture, {$<$}4 mm-soil fraction). Outdoor experiments were conducted with non-labelled substances in small lysimeters of 20 cm diameter. In five of six parallel biometer experiments, DT50 values (half-lives) under simulated outdoor conditions were up to 2.5 times longer than in standard experiments. This is probably due to the lower average temperature under simulated outdoor conditions as compared with standard conditions. In all experiments, non-extractable residues were lower under simulated outdoor than under standard conditions. Comparison of DT50 values from biometer tests under simulated outdoor conditions to those of fallow lysimeter experiments revealed shorter DT50 values outdoors. Only for chlortoluron, the DT50 outdoors was 1.5 times longer than under simulated outdoor conditions. DT50 values determined in standard experiments gave better estimates of the disappearance of the investigated substances in fallow lysimeters.},

In fact, beside primary sources of microplastics such as cosmetic products and textile fires, there are secondary microplastics generated from plastic items due to weathering agents and biological degradation. While the marine and fresh water environments are actually of great concern, ground environments, and matrices related to it, have been less considered in the last years research about microplastics detection. Major attention should be reserved to solid heterogeneous matrices, such as soil, compost, sediments and sludges. Worldwide regulations about compost, which is used as amendant in agricultural fields, have a threshold ranging from 2 to 15~mm for the requirements related to plastic impurities. Microplastics which pass through the mesh of the threshold sieve are considered assimilable to compost. One of the main lacks that prevents the improvement of these regulation, is a standard protocol for microplastics detection in solid heterogeneous matrices. To this purpose, the current review proposes an outline of methods tested in previous research for microplastics recovery and identification in the matrices of our interest.},

  abstract = {Potato is one of the most important crops in the world because of its high nutritional value; however, traditional cultivation in bare soil may render low yields and poor quality. Crop production efficiency can be increased by using plastic mulching and row covers to modify root zone temperature and plant growth, in addition to reduction in pest damage and enhance production in cultivated plants. However, there is little information demonstrating the effect of row covers in combination with plastic mulch on potato. The aim of this study was to assess the change in root zone temperature and its effect on growth, leaf nutrient, and yield of potato using plastic mulch of different colors, in combination with row covers. Seed of cultivar Mondial was planted in May 2012. The study included four plastic films: black, white/black, silver/black, aluminum/black, and a control with bare soil, which were evaluated alone and in combination with row covers removed at 30 days after sowing in a split-plot design. Higher yields were obtained when no row cover (43.2 t ha−1) and the white/black film (42.2 t ha−1) were used. Leaf nitrogen, sulfur, and manganese concentration were higher in plants when row cover was used; in contrast, no–row cover plants were higher in Fe and Zn. Mulched plants were higher in Mn concentration than control plants. There was a quadratic relationship between mean soil temperature and total yield (R2 = 0.94), and between plant biomass and total yield (R2 = 0.98), between leaf area with total yield (R2 = 0.98).},

Studies of microlitter impacts are mostly based on virgin and spherical polymer particles as model MP. However, in pelagic and benthic environments, surfaces are always colonized by microorganisms forming so-called biofilms. The influence of such biofilms on the fate and potential effects of MP is not understood well. Here, we review the physical interactions of early microbial colonization on plastic surfaces and their reciprocal influence on the weathering processes and vertical transport as well as sorption and release of contaminants by MP. Possible ecological consequences of biofilm formation on MP, such as trophic transfer of MP particles and potential adverse effects of MP, are virtually unknown. However, evidence is accumulating that the biofilm−plastic interactions have the capacity to influence the fate and impacts of MP by modifying the physical properties of the particles. There is an urgent research need to better understand these interactions and increase the ecological relevance of current laboratory testing by simulating field conditions in which microbial life is a key driver of biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {In this study we investigated the quantitative and qualitative aspects of soil organic matter (SOM) losses caused by water erosion within a small catchment in Northern Laos, under steep slopes and slash and burn agriculture. The soils in the region have a high contribution of black carbon to soil organic matter and high erosion rates. The aim of the study was to quantify the erosion of black carbon and to identify the processes involved. The conceptual approach included the measurement of contents of SOM, black carbon and mineral bound SOM in bulk soils, sediments eroded from 1 m2 plots and in sediments at the outlet of the 0.6 ha catchment. Additionally, the enrichment factors of bulk SOM, BC and mineral bound SOM were calculated for eroded sediments. Carbon content of eroded sediments was higher than carbon content in bulk soil. The C enrichment factors in the sediments eroded from 1 m2 plots ranged between 1.7 and 2.7, which confirms that SOM rich material such as clay or silt along with particulate organic matter such as black carbon and plant debris is preferentially eroded. At the watershed level a mean carbon enrichment factor of 1.5 showed that part of the eroded carbon is lost from the watershed. Analysis of the carbon types showed that mineral bound SOM is representing on average 30\% and black carbon 15\% of the carbon of the bulk soil. Mineral bound organic matter is not eroded preferentially from the soil. Enrichment factors from 1.1 to 1.8 were recorded for black carbon in sediments eroded from 1 m2 plots. At the watershed level, black carbon represents 30\% of carbon in eroded sediments. The average enrichment factor of black carbon in sediments eroded from the watershed is 2.3 compared to bulk soil C content. These results show a continuous enrichment of sediments in black carbon during the whole process of soil erosion. The preferential erosion of black carbon compared to other SOM types can be explained by its light nature, absence of mineral interactions right after its formation and its resistance to biodegradation during transport. Carbon erosion in these tropical soils may thus lead to a decrease of their ability to act as a sink for CO2 due to the preferential exportation of a very stable SOM form. These results further suggest that erosion of black carbon could be a crucial process determining its fate in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, black carbon erosion could be conceptually simpler than soil erosion and could therefore be tackled by specific models.},

This research has investigated the possibility of the use of De-Oiled Pomace (DOP) as an eco-friendly tool for weed control in a high-density olive orchard providing an environmental comparison with other soil management techniques. Five methods of weed control have been compared in a two-year experimental orchard at the Bari University (Southern Italy): mulching with de-oiled olive pomace (DOP), nonwoven tissue (TNT) and polyethylene film (PEN), chemical (CHI) and mechanical (MEC) weeding, on the three most adapted to high-density orchards olive cultivars (Arbequina, Arbosana and Koroneiki). The data collected during the experimental test are submitted to an LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) analysis and five scenarios have been drafted based on DOP use and destinations. The results showed that the chemical wedding produced the greatest environmental burdens, and the higher environmental performances of DOP mulching scenarios for all environmental indexes, with burdens reductions and/or environmental credits. The presence in the following years of some biomarkers sensitive to macro and micro pollutants and heavy metals, in experimental plots mulched with DOP, confirmed the high environmental sustainability of this technique, excluding any kind of soil pollution in the medium-term period in the high-density olive orchard.},

  abstract = {The industrial plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is used in manufacturing of a wide variety of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-containing medical and consumer products. DEHP belongs to a class of chemicals known as peroxisome proliferators (PPs). PPs are a structurally diverse group of compounds that share many (but perhaps not all) biological effects and are characterized as non-genotoxic rodent carcinogens. This review focuses on the effect of DEHP in liver, a primary target organ for the pleiotropic effects of DEHP and other PPs. Specifically, liver parenchymal cells, identified herein as hepatocytes, are a major cell type that are responsive to exposure to PPs, including DEHP; however, other cell types in the liver may also play a role. The PP-induced increase in the number and size of peroxisomes in hepatocytes, so called ‘peroxisome proliferation' that results in elevation of fatty acid metabolism, is a hallmark response to these compounds in the liver. A link between peroxisome proliferation and tumor formation has been a predominant, albeit questioned, theory to explain the cause of a hepatocarcinogenic effect of PPs. Other molecular events, such as induction of cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative DNA damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells have been also been proposed to be critically involved in PP-induced carcinogenesis in liver. Considerable differences in the metabolism and molecular changes induced by DEHP in the liver, most predominantly the activation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, have been identified between species. Both sexes of rats and mice develop adenomas and carcinomas after prolonged feeding with DEHP; however, limited DEHP-specific human data are available, even though exposure to DEHP and other phthalates is common in the general population. This likely constitutes the largest gap in our knowledge on the potential for DEHP to cause liver cancer in humans. Overall, it is believed that the sequence of key events that are relevant to DEHP-induced liver carcinogenesis in rodents involves the following events whereby the combination of the molecular signals and multiple pathways, rather than a single hallmark event (such as induction of PPARα and peroxisomal genes, or cell proliferation) contribute to the formation of tumors: (i) rapid metabolism of the parental compound to primary and secondary bioactive metabolites that are readily absorbed and distributed throughout the body; (ii) receptor-independent activation of hepatic macrophages and production of oxidants; (iii) activation of PPARα in hepatocytes and sustained increase in expression of peroxisomal and non-peroxisomal metabolism-related genes; (iv) enlargement of many hepatocellular organelles (peroxisomes, mitochondria, etc.); (v) rapid but transient increase in cell proliferation, and a decrease in apoptosis; (vi) sustained hepatomegaly; (vii) chronic low-level oxidative stress and accumulation of DNA damage; (viii) selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; (ix) appearance of the pre-neoplastic nodules; (x) development of adenomas and carcinomas.},

Increase in total yield (first and second year crops) was on average about 41\% higher with mulched treatments than with the control. Among the mulched treatments, total yield was highest with the elephant grass on plastic treatment. The yield of the second year crop was on average about 57\% lower than that of the first year crop.

A viable strategy to overcome this accumulation is to replace conventional with biodegradable mulch films composed of polymers designed to be degraded by soil microorganisms. However, understanding polymer biodegradation in soils remains a significant challenge due to its dependence on polymer properties, soil characteristics, and prevailing environmental conditions. This perspective aims to advance our understanding of the three fundamental steps underlying biodegradation of mulch films in agricultural soils: colonization of the polymer film surfaces by soil microorganisms, depolymerization of the polymer films by extracellular microbial hydrolases, and subsequent microbial assimilation and utilization of the hydrolysis products for energy production and biomass formation. The perspective synthesizes the current conceptual understanding of these steps and highlights existing knowledge gaps. The discussion addresses future research and analytical advancements required to overcome the knowledge gaps and to identify the key polymer properties and soil characteristics governing mulch film biodegradation in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {‘Capable-of-being-shaped’ synthetic compounds are prevailing today over horn, bone, leather, wood, stone, metal, glass, or ceramic in products that were previously left to natural materials. Plastic is, in fact, economical, simple, adaptable, and waterproof. Also, it is durable and resilient to natural degradation (although microbial species capable of degrading plastics do exist). In becoming a waste, plastic accumulation adversely affects ecosystems. The majority of plastic debris pollutes waters, accumulating in oceans. And, the behaviour and the quantity of plastic, which has become waste, are rather well documented in the water, in fact. This review collects existing information on plastics in the soil, paying particular attention to both their degradation and possible re-uses. The use of plastics in agriculture is also considered. The discussion is organised according to their resin type and the identification codes used in recycling programs. In addition, options for post-consumer plastics are considered. Acknowledged indicators do not exist, and future study they will have to identify viable and shared methods to measure the presence and the degradation of individual polymers in soils.},

The introduction of biodegradable materials, which can be disposed directly into the soil, can be one possible solution to this problem. Biodegradable materials are actually innovative materials; therefore, their physical properties must be evaluated in relation to their functionality during the use in field. In the present research results of experimental tests carried out on biodegradable films used in strawberries protected cultivation are presented. The decay of some relevant physical parameters of biodegradable films during the cultivation period was monitored by laboratory tests (SEM analysis, mechanical tensile tests and infrared reflectance spectroscopy). Infrared spectroscopy clearly indicated that the mechanical degradation starts from the starch component of the material. Tensile tests showed that the value of elongation at break of biodegradable materials decreased in some cases by 300\% after 10 days of field application.},

In this contribution, the amorphous nature of soil organic matter (SOM) is reviewed with respect to the glassy/rubbery model, glass transition mechanisms, interactions of SOM with water, and physical aging. Glass-transition behavior and physical aging are inherent properties of amorphous solids, and numerous spectroscopic investigations give insights into different domain mobilities of humic substances (HS). The correlation between sorption nonlinearity and glassiness of polymers and HS supports a relation between sorption and amorphicity in Aldrich humic acid. Further evidence is still required for the transfer to soil HS and SOM. Sorption and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data suggest a correlation between aromaticity and glassiness in HS, and the available data do currently not allow to decide unambiguously between specific sorption and hole filling as explanation. This needs to be verified in future research. Although parts of the investigations have up to now only been conducted with humic substances, the collectivity of available data give strong support for the glassy/rubbery conception of SOM. They clearly indicate that amorphous characteristics cannot be excluded in SOM. This is further supported by the observation of different types of glass-transition behavior in samples of whole humous soil. In addition to classical glass transitions in water-free soil samples, water surprisingly acts in an antagonistic way as short-term plasticizer and long-term antiplasticizer in a second, nonclassical transition type. Latter is closely connected with physico-chemical interactions with water and suggests water bridges between structural elements of SOM (HBCL-model). The gradual increase of Tg* in SOM indicates physico-chemical aging processes, which are not restricted to polymers. They may be responsible for contaminant aging, changes in surface properties and increased soil compaction in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Sewage sludge used as agricultural fertilizer has been identified as an important source of microplastics (MPs) to the environment. However, the fate of MPs added to agricultural soils is largely unknown. This study investigated the fate of MPs in agricultural soils amended with sewage sludge and the role of surface water runoff as a mechanism driving their transfer to aquatic ecosystems. This was assessed using three experimental plots located in a semi-arid area of Central Spain, which were planted with barley. The experimental plots received the following treatments: (1) control or no sludge application; (2) historical sludge application, five years prior to the experiment; and (3) sludge application at the beginning of the experiment. MPs were analyzed in surface water runoff and in different soil layers to investigate transport and infiltration for one year. The sewage sludge used in our experiment contained 5972–7771~MPs/kg dw. Based on this, we estimated that about 16,000~MPs were added to the agricultural plot amended with sludge. As expected, the sludge application significantly increased the MP concentration in soils. The control plot contained low MP concentrations (31–120~MPs~kg−1 dw), potentially originating from atmospheric deposition. The plot treated five years prior to the experiment contained 226–412 and 177–235~MPs kg−1 dw at the start and end of the experiment, respectively; while the recently treated plot contained 182–231 and 138–288~MPs~kg−1 dw. Our study shows that MP concentrations remain relatively constant in agricultural soils and that the MP infiltration capacity is very low. Surface water runoff had a negligible influence on the export of MPs from agricultural soils, mobilizing only 0.2–0.4\% of the MPs added with sludge. We conclude that, in semi-arid regions, agricultural soils can be considered as long-term accumulators of MPs.},

Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify MP abundance in water and sediment of the German river Elbe using visual, spectroscopic (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) and thermo analytical (pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry) methods. Samples from eleven German sites along the German part of the Elbe were collected, both in water and sediment phase, in order to better understand MP sinks and transport mechanisms. MP concentrations differed between the water and sediment phase. Sediment concentrations (mean: 3,350,000 particles m−3, 125–5000 μm MP) were in average 600,000-fold higher than water concentrations (mean: 5.57 particles m−3, 150–5000 μm MP). The abundance varied between the sampling sites: In sediments, the abundance decreased in the course of the river while in water samples no such clear trend was observed. This may be explained by a barrage retaining sediments and tidal influence in the upstream parts of the river. Particle shape differed sitespecifically with one site having exceptionally high quantities of spheres, most probably due to industrial emissions of PS-DVB resin beads. Suspended MP consisted predominantly of polyethylene and polypropylene whereas sediments contained a higher diversity of polymer types. Determined MP concentrations correspond well to previous results from other European rivers. In a global context, MP levels in the Elbe relate to the lower (water) to middle section (sediment) of the global range of MP concentrations determined for rivers worldwide. This highlights that elevated MP levels are not only found in single countries or continents, but that MP pollution is an issue of global concern.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous detection of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems promotes the concern for adverse impacts on freshwater ecosystems. The wide variety of material types, sizes, shapes, and physicochemical properties renders interactions with biota via multiple pathways probable.So far, our knowledge about the uptake and biological effects of microplastics comes from laboratory studies, applying simplified exposure regimes (e.g., one polymer and size, spherical shape, high concentrations) often with limited environmental relevance. However, the available data illustrates species- and material-related interactions and highlights that microplastics represent a multifaceted stressor. Particle-related toxicities will be driven by polymer type, size, and shape. Chemical toxicity is driven by the adsorption-desorption kinetics of additives and pollutants. In addition, microbial colonization, the formation of hetero-aggregates, and the evolutionary adaptations of the biological receptor further increase the complexity of microplastics as stressors. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to synthesize and critically revisit these aspects based on the state of the science in freshwater research. Where unavailable we supplement this with data on marine biota. This provides an insight into the direction of future research.In this regard, the challenge is to understand the complex interactions of biota and plastic materials and to identify the toxicologically most relevant characteristics of the plethora of microplastics. Importantly, as the direct biological impacts of natural particles may be similar, future research needs to benchmark synthetic against natural materials. Finally, given the scale of the research question, we need a multidisciplinary approach to understand the role of microplastics in a multiple-particle world.},

These artificial particles are found in and pose threats to aquatic systems worldwide. MPs have terrestrial sources, but their concentrations and fates in the terrestrial environment are poorly understood. While global plastic production continues to increase, so do the environmental concentrations and impacts of MPs. In this first study of MPs in floodplain soils, we developed a method for identifying, quantifying, and measuring the sizes of most commonly produced MPs in soil by FT-IR microscopy. For small MP ({$<$}1 mm) analysis, MP were separated by density separation and oxidation of organic matter. In this study we analyzed 29 floodplains in Swiss nature reserves associated with catchments covering 53\% of Switzerland. We found evidence that 90\% of Swiss floodplain soils contain MPs. The highest MP concentrations were associated with the concentration of mesoplastics (5 mm − 2.5 cm diameter), indicating plastic waste as source. Furthermore, MP concentration was correlated with the population of the catchment. The wide distribution of MPs, their presence in remote unsettled high mountain areas, decoupling of MEP and MP compositions, and the dominance of MPs by small ({$<$}500 μm diameter) particles, indicate that MPs enter soils via diffuse aeolian transport.},

The sensitive and selective FT-IR technique is in particular useful for the analysis of organic molecules but also for infrared active permanent gases evolved during most decomposition processes. The coupling interface between thermal analyzers and FT-IR spectrometers usually consists of heated adapters and a flexible, heated transfer line. In this work, a novel direct coupling of an STA instrument and an FT-IR spectrometer without a transfer line is presented. A very small FT-IR spectrometer is directly mounted on top of the STA furnace leading to a compact and fully integrated STA-FT-IR coupling system. The possibilities and the value of simultaneous STA-FT-IR measurements are demonstrated for organic, biomass, and ceramic samples in the temperature range between room temperature and about 1,500 A degrees C. Various samples from the field of inorganics and organics-especially polymers-were furthermore measured showing the advantages of the direct STA-FT-IR coupling compared to state-of-the-art STA-FT-IR coupling using a heated transfer line: we found that the time delay caused by the volume of the transfer line itself is rather negligible whereas a significantly better correlation between gas detection and TG results was observed in case of some highly condensable decomposition gases. Aspects of quantification of evolved gases are furthermore discussed as well as the known nonlinearity of FT-IR detection at higher gas concentrations.},

However, the quantitative analysis continues being a critical issue, in particular for MPLs from 100 μm down to the nano-sized range in complex environmental samples. This paper evaluates the potential of mass spectrometry for the analysis of MPLs and NPLs. The performance of different techniques including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and the ambient ionisation approaches as desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) and direct analysis real-time (DART), were assessed for the study of polystyrene (PS) MPLs and NPLs in natural waters. A method based on LC-HRMS, equipped with an atmospheric pressure photoionisation source (APPI), operated in negative conditions for the quantitative analysis of PS MPLs and NPLs in natural waters, was developed. The chromatographic separation was achieved using an advanced polymer chromatographic (APC) column using toluene isocratic as the mobile phase. The optimal analytical method showed an instrumental limit of detection (ILOD) of 20 pg and methods limits of detection and quantification around 30 pg L−1 and 100 pg L−1, respectively. And, recoveries of 60 and 70\% in samples from rivers and the marine coast, respectively. The performance of the new method was proved by the analysis of fortified samples and natural seawater samples.},

  abstract = {In agriculture, the use of plastic mulch (plasticulture) is globally increasing. Besides beneficial effects on crop yield and quality, possible adverse environmental effects associated with plastic mulch are currently under debate. Aside from the obvious disadvantages of substantial amounts of (micro)plastic waste, adverse effects on soil quality and biodiversity might be assumed. We compared the effect of plastic mulch and organic mulch (straw) systems in strawberry cultivation on soil invertebrates and biological activity in an observational field study in the Upper Rhine valley, Germany. Soil invertebrates were collected using pitfall traps and Berlese-Tullgren-funnels, earthworms by hand sorting. Soil biological activity was determined using bait-lamina sticks and the MicroResp™ system. Soil samples from test fields were analysed for physicochemical and microbial parameters. Despite minor effects on soil physicochemical parameters, our results showed that the mulch system had a significant effect on the community structure of soil invertebrates. In strawberry fields with plastic mulch we found a decreased taxonomic richness and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing soil temperature. About 50\% of the analysed taxa had significantly lower abundances in plastic mulched fields compared to fields with organic mulch. No investigated taxon had a higher abundance in plastic mulched fields. Soil moisture was the most important environmental variable in explaining invertebrate abundances. The soil microbial activity was significantly lower in plastic mulched fields than in fields with organic mulch. Our results indicate that even little shifts in abiotic (e.g. temperature, water content) and biotic (e.g. food availability) conditions associated with the plastic mulch system can have strong effects on soil invertebrates and soil microbial activity. Hence, plastic mulch might pose a threat to soil biodiversity and related ecosystem functions in agroecosystems. We call for further studies analysing the influence of plasticulture, to better evaluate the long-term consequences on agrobiodiversity and soil quality as well as sustainability.},

  abstract = {Following the widespread assumption that a majority of ubiquitous marine microplastic particles originate from land-based sources, recent studies identify rivers as important pathways for microplastic particles (MPP) to the oceans. Yet a detailed understanding of the underlying processes and dominant sources is difficult to obtain with the existing accurate but extremely time-consuming methods available for the identification of MPP. Thus in the presented study, a novel approach applying short-wave infrared imaging spectroscopy for the quick and semi-automated identification of MPP is applied in combination with a multitemporal survey concept. Volume-reduced surface water samples were taken from transects at ten points along a major watercourse running through the South of Berlin, Germany, on six dates. After laboratory treatment, the samples were filtered onto glass fiber filters, scanned with an imaging spectrometer and analyzed by image processing. The presented method allows to count MPP, classify the plastic types and determine particle sizes. At the present stage of development particles larger than 450 μm in diameter can be identified and a visual validation showed that the results are reliable after a subsequent visual final check of certain typical error types. Therefore, the method has the potential to accelerate microplastic identification by complementing FTIR and Raman microspectroscopy. Technical advancements (e.g. new lens) will allow lower detection limits and a higher grade of automatization in the near future. The resulting microplastic concentrations in the water samples are discussed in a spatio-temporal context with respect to the influence (i) of urban areas, (ii) of effluents of three major Berlin wastewater treatment plants discharging into the canal and (iii) of precipitation events. Microplastic concentrations were higher downstream of the urban area and after precipitation. An increase in microplastic concentrations was discernible for the wastewater treatment plant located furthest upstream though not for the other two.},

  abstract = {Globally, soil organic matter (SOM) contains more than three times as much carbon as either the atmosphere or terrestrial vegetation. Yet it remains largely unknown why some SOM persists for millennia whereas other SOM decomposes readily—and this limits our ability to predict how soils will respond to climate change. Recent analytical and experimental advances have demonstrated that molecular structure alone does not control SOM stability: in fact, environmental and biological controls predominate. Here we propose ways to include this understanding in a new generation of experiments and soil carbon models, thereby improving predictions of the SOM response to global warming.},

  abstract = {The drug “mumia vera” has a long tradition in ancient medicine. It was considered an omnipotent panacea for a broad spectrum of diseases based on virtue associated with asphalt and other bituminous substances combined with the belief in the magic healing power of death. This made it a precious ingredient of medication and it represents a particular facet of medicinal cannibalism. “Mumia” was a common, and much sought after, component of pharmacists’ stock in trade, particularly in the Middle Ages. A shortage of sources for authentic mummies from Egypt resulted in the production of fakes, including dried human bodies. A rare tiny residue in a historic 18th century pharmaceutical vessel labelled MUMIA was microscopically subsampled and analysed with Curie point pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (CP-py-GC–MS) and GC–MS. From the data (e.g. fatty acids, terpenes, triterpenoids, n-alkanes, n-alkenes, wax esters) there is strong evidence that the vessel contained authentic mummy material. All subsamples could be put into a logical context of the mummification process and its product, i.e. fibres from bandages, wrappings or filling material, conifer wood fibres as a possible part of cover material, “used” embalming material in the form of a mixture of cedrium, pistachia resin (possibly Chios turpentine) and beeswax, (hydrolysed) fat (evidently including human sebum, possibly adipocere), mummified skin or tissue (possibly treated with polyunsaturated plant oil, highly oxidised by the time of analysis) and Dead Sea asphalt with a possible admixture of some asphalt from a different source.},

A 100-mm thick hay mulch added sufficient organic carbon (C) and N to replace seasonal soil OM losses expected for temperate zone soils. Paper and plastic mulches contributed little or no OM, but mulching alleys between film-mulched beds helped replenish soil OM in these mulching systems. At one site, soil NO3-N was higher under plastic and oiled-paper mulches than under organic mulches or without mulch, probably because plastic and oiled paper reduced leaching of NO3-N. Mulch treatment did not affect soil NO3-N at other sites, and generally did not affect tomato foliar TKN, except when the treatment reduced soil moisture levels. Hay and compost mulches had C:N ratios ranging from 24 to 48, but high foliar TKN in these treatments indicated that the mulches did not reduce N availability to the crop. Mulch treatments imposed for a single growing season did not affect soil bulk density, steady state water infiltration rate or wet aggregate stability. However, earthworm populations at the end of the season were about twice as high under hay mulch as under black plastic.},

Hay mulches applied at 15 to 24 Mg ha−1 (ca. 100 mm depth) several weeks after tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) planting substantially reduced the growth of annual weeds, and sometimes resulted in a net labor saving compared to the unmulched treatment. Grass seed carried by hay contributed visibly to weed growth in only one out of eight trials. A mulch of composted yard waste at 117 to 196 Mg ha−1 (ca. 30–50 mm depth) was less effective against weeds than the hay mulch. Black plastic (32 μm thick embossed black polyethylene) blocked weeds except for a few emerging through planting holes. Labor requirements for mulching (including end-of-season removal) and transplanting were greater for plastic than for organic mulches, so that no net labor savings were realized. Alleys between plastic-mulched rows also required other weed control measures. Kraft paper mulches decomposed before the end of the season, and thus provided less weed control than plastic. However, two layers of newsprint laid under hay or straw significantly enhanced weed suppression by the organic mulch.}

Preliminary results of structural modeling and geometry optimization of HA, SOM, and soil particles are introduced. Molecular mechanics calculations to evaluate the conformation of structural, three-dimensional models and to determine first quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) properties are put forward. QSAR investigations allow the correlation of molecular structures with soil properties such as mass, surface area, volume, partial charges (electronegativity), polarizability, refractivity, hydrophobicity, and hydration energy. The principal aim and long-term strategy are to develop structural concepts of SOM and soil particles which explain their composition as well as their ecological meaning, dynamic character and structure-property relationships in whole soils. Focal points in the applications of analytical pyrolysis in soil science are, first, the dynamics of soil organic matter such as formation, turnover, seasonal variations, and influence of soil managements and second, ecological consequences such as characterization of contaminated soils (sewage farms, bound residues).},

  abstract = {Summary Heavy density fractions of soil contain organic matter tightly bound to the surface of soil minerals. The chemical composition and ecological meaning of non-metabolic decomposition products and microbial metabolites in organic–mineral bonds is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the heavy fraction (density {$>~$}2~g~cm–3) from the topsoil of a Gleysol (Bainsville, Ottawa, Canada). It accounted for 952~g~kg–1 of soil and contained 19~g~kg–1 of organic C. Pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectra showed intensive signals of carbohydrates, and phenols and lignin monomers, alkylaromatics (mostly aromatic) N-containing compounds, and peptides. These classes of compound have been proposed as structural building blocks of soil organic matter. In comparison, the light fraction (density {$>~$}2~g~cm–3) was richer in lignin dimers, lipids, sterols, suberin and fatty acids which clearly indicate residues of plants and biota. To confirm the composition and stability of mineral-bound organic matter, we also investigated the heavy fraction (density {$>~$}2.2~g~cm–3) from clay-, silt- and sand-sized separates of the topsoil of a Chernozem (Bad Lauchstädt, Germany). These heavy size separates differed in their mass spectra but were generally characterized by volatilization maxima of alkylaromatics, lipids and sterols at about 500°C. We think that the observed high-temperature volatilization of these structural building blocks of soil organic matter is indicative of the organic–mineral bonds. Some unexpected low-temperature volatilization of carbohydrates, N-containing compounds, peptides, and phenols and lignin monomers was assigned to hot-water-extractable organic matter which accounted for 7–27\% of the carbon and nitrogen in the heavy fractions. As this material is known to be mineralizable, our study indicates that these constituents of the heavy density fractions are degradable by micro-organisms and involved in the turnover of soil organic matter.},

For particles {$>$} 300 nm, such transfer is biologically implausible as the peritrophic membrane retains these in the daphnid gut. Thus, we aim at replicating the key study by Rosenkranz et al. (2009). We used confocal laser scanning microscopy to study the tissue transfer applying the original setup (neonates exposed to 20 and 1,000 nm PS beads at 2 µg L-1 for 4 and 24 h), the same setup with a fructose-based clearing, and a setup with a 1,000-fold higher concentration (2 mg L-1). We used passive sampling to investigate whether the beads leach the fluorescent dye. While the 1,000 nm beads were visible in the gut at both exposure concentrations, the 20 nm beads were detectable at 2 mg L-1, only. At this concentration, we observed fluorescence in lipid droplets in daphnids exposed to both particle types. However, this did not co-localize with the 1,000 nm beads which remained visible in the gut. We further confirmed the leaching of the fluorescent dye using a passive sampler, a method that can also be applied in future studies. In summary, we cannot replicate the original study but demonstrate that the fluorescence in the lipid droplets of D. magna results from leaching of the dye. Thus, the use of fluorescence as a surrogate for particles can lead to artifacts in uptake and translocation studies. This highlights the need to confirm the stability of the fluorescence label or to localize particles using alternative methods. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Fate and behavior as well as ecotoxicity are of increasing environmental concern particularly in sediments and soils as natural sinks. For a global environmental risk assessment reliable and easy to apply analytical methods are mandatory to obtain comparable data. This is based on the isolation of microplastics out of the solid sample matrices prior to instrumental detection. Thus, this study provides a validated approach for density separation, which emerged from a comparative study using different salt solutions to isolate conventional and for the first time biodegradable microplastics from different solid sample matrices, i.e., sand, artificial soil, and compost. Four solutions (water, sodium chloride, sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium bromide) of different densities were applied followed by oxidizing digestion. Finally, the impact of the procedures on size and surface properties of microplastics was tested. Dependent on the sample matrix, highest recovery rates of 87.3-100.3 \% for conventional polymers and 38.2\&amp;ndash;78.2 \% for biodegradable polymers were determined with sodium bromide. It could be shown that the type of solid sample matrix influences the recovery rates and has to be considered when choosing a sample preparation technique.},

The problem of low Raman scattering was overcome by trapping particles with 2D optical tweezers. This setup enabled RM to identify particles of different materials (polymers and inorganic) in the size range from 200 nm to 5 µm, with concentrations in the order of 1 mg/L (109 particles L-1). The hyphenation was realized for asymmetric flow FFF (AF4) and centrif-ugal FFF (CF3), which separate particles based on different properties.

With pyrolysis 2-oxoalkanes and 2-oxoalkenes as well as carboxylic acids were identified as the degradation products. Thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation was successfully applied to assess the degree of oxidation, especially targeting the more polar compounds. With this technique alkane dioic acids have been identified as valuable marker compounds for the oxidative degradation of polyethylene. The mechanism of formation of fatty acids in thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation has been elucidated using two different alkanones. With size exclusion chromatography it could be shown that the oxidation occurs randomly along the polymer chain and that the final degradation products are in the range of a few thousand gmol−1, irrespective of the original molar mass.},

For validating the method, soil and compost samples were spiked with six different micro-polymers: polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane. The obtained results are promising, and the polymer density had only a small role in the recovery rate: low, medium and high density polymers reached a mean recovery rate of 90\% ±2\%, 97\%~±~5\% and 95\%~±~4\%, respectively.},

Only a very small amount of thiophenes was found. The ratio between the hydrocarbons changed somewhat with sample size, because of a change of the temperature gradient in the sample. Rates of formation for C6 and C7 hydrocarbons were the same for the different polythiophenes. The different chemical environment of the thiophenic ring influenced the rate of formation of H2S and the yield of sulphur.

  abstract = {Study of hazardous microplastics in the natural water resources is minimal compared to the sea salt, seafood and even packaged water. We presented results of the first baseline research of microplastics in groundwater and surface water from the coastal south India (Tamil Nadu state) and evaluated the heavy metal adsorption capacities of different polymers. The microplastics (up to 19.9 particles/L) were of relatively larger size in surface water (0.34–4.30 mm) compared to the groundwater (0.12–2.50 mm). Polyamide (nylon), polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and cellulose were the common polymers and all of them showed different capacities of heavy metal adsorption. In two different experimental sites, the polypropylene showed higher capacity of adsorption compared to other polymers in the following orders: (i) cadmium {$>$} manganese {$>$} lead {$>$} arsenic and (ii) manganese {$>$} zinc {$>$} arsenic {$>$} lead {$>$} copper. The polyamide, however, exhibited better adsorption only for manganese. Similar to other recent findings, our results associate microplastics as a major vector to transport heavy metals in the water system. Formulation of strategies to reduce the environmental risks of particulate plastics as a potent vector for transportation of the toxic trace elements and subsequent, impact on human health through the OSPRC framework (Origins, Sources, Pathways, Receptors and Consequence) in the study area would require future research.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is commonly used as an indicator of soil quality, with different fractions being used as indices to measure changes in SOM caused by management. The objective of this study was to compare whether selected SOM fractions exhibited sensitivity to short-term changes in management. The experiment was conducted for ∼3 yr as a split-split-plot design with crop rotation as the whole-plot treatment factor, tillage as the subplot treatment factor, and cover crop management as the sub-subplot treatment factor. Soil samples were collected at the 0- to 15-cm depth. Soil organic C (SOC) and N, particulate organic matter (POM), free light fraction (FLF), Illinois soil N test (ISNT), and easily oxidizable C (EOC) were tested as possible sensitive indices to changes in management. The stable fraction SOC was only affected by cover crop management, while C and N contents and C/N ratio of the labile POM and FLF fractions were affected by additional management practices. Between POM and FLF, the latter was the most sensitive, with cover crop management having the greatest effect. Because FLF is chemically and structurally closer to plant residues than POM, the sensitivity rank position of these fractions would probably be at least more similar if only tillage management was considered. In addition, the lack of sensitivity of ISNT and EOC to any tested management practice is added to previous studies that have raised questions of the representation of the labile SOM pool through these fractions.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution of the environment, especially of marine and freshwater ecosystems has been receiving growing public and scientific attention over the past few years. Plastic pollution of soils has however been neglected, even though it is estimated that the contamination of soils with plastic is considerable. Especially microplastic pollution of soils is being increasingly documented. Sources of plastic pollution are manifold and diverse. In agroecosystems, secondary raw material fertilisers or plastic mulch have been identified as one of the main origins of plastics in soil. So far, there are no existing legal threshold values addressing the input of plastics into soil. As part of the new soil protection regulation in Vorarlberg, threshold and precautionary levels for soils have now been implemented. Since no standardised methods to investigate contaminated soils existed, a method for sampling and analysis of plastics {$>$} 1mm has been developed. Several agricultural soils have been analysed. The results clearly showed that the use of secondary raw material fertilisers such as sewage sludge compost and digestate are leading to a notable input of plastics into agricultural soils. A comparison of our results with an external microplastic analysis (0,05 – 0,5 mm) furthermore indicated a correlation of meso- and microplastic contamination, suggesting possible fragmentation of mesoplastics in soil. However, our analysis also showed that sampling of plastic contaminated soils is challenging and still needs further improvement. Due to the heterogenic dispersion of plastic fragments in soil and on the soil surface, as well as the various sizes and properties of plastic particles, it is difficult to obtain conclusive samples and in a further step get significant results. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the pollution of soils with plastics is an issue of growing concern, which cannot be neglected. Once plastic has entered the soil, it is being fragmented into smaller particles with yet unknown consequences. It is therefore crucial to further investigate the extent, sources and behaviour of plastic contamination in soils.},

  abstract = {When  temperate soils are cultivated, rates of organic matter mineralization rarely exceed  50\% of total carbon (C) for about 50 to 100 years of cultivation, and the remaining  soil organic matter contributes to soil quality by storing nutrients and providing  aggregation. In weathered tropical soils, rates of C loss caused by cultivation are  many times faster than those for temperate soils, with a substantial deterioration  in soil quality often in less than 10 years. Here we examine the role of minerals  and microaggregation in organic matter stability in the search for a stable organic  C pool in a semiarid tropical soil (Oxisol) from the Chapada de Araripe in Pernambuco,  NE Brazil. In this soil, 14\% of the C and N was lost in 6 years of manual shifting  cultivation, after which it was abandoned.         Carbon in the sand fraction accounted  for 22\% of total soil C and declined by 40\% upon cultivation. Although silt and silt-sized  microaggregates accounted for only 10\% of total soil mass, they contained nearly  half the soil C, which declined by 13\% during cultivation. Clay-associated C (27\%  of soil C) showed no decline because of a mass transfer from sand and silt-sized  microaggregates to clay, probably as a result of their destabilization under cultivation.  Chemical oxidation with 0.03 M KMnO4 was able to predict the proportion  of labile C and indicated a decreased organic matter stability after cultivation.  Density and magnetic fractionation indicated that organo-mineral complexes were broken  down during cultivation, with a subsequent mineralization of C and redistribution  to finer, lighter fractions. The most stable fraction appeared to be in silt-sized  microaggregates and in clays of intermediate magnetic susceptibility, indicating  its association with Fe of low crystallinity. Even this most resistant fraction showed  a 14C age of only about 100 years, approximately double that of the whole  soil but only one-tenth of values typical of resistant fractions in temperate soils.  This result indicates that organic matter of weathered tropical soils may be less  stable than assumed, that rapid degradation of soil quality is possible, and that  organic matter management should be a priority for sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract = {Plastic nanoparticles (PNPs) are considered contaminants of emerging concern, but little information is available on their transport behavior in the soil-water environment, as well as their behavior relative to metal and other carbon-based nanoparticles. Here we show that size and surface functional groups affect the transport of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) through saturated soil. Unmodified 110~nm and 50~nm PS-NPs demonstrated similar transport patterns in soil. However, a maximum elution value of 90\% from the soil was found for the 50~nm PS-NPs, compared to a maximum value of ∼45\% for 110~nm PS-NPs. The breakthrough curve for 190~nm PS-NPs demonstrated a maximum elution value of 60\% from the soil. PS-NPs with surface functional groups display different mobility profiles: carboxylated PS-NPs demonstrated a plateau of 40\% elution from the soil, while aminated PS-NPs were eluted only in small amounts and showed a spike pattern of elution from the column. These findings are attributed to the effects of common soil constituents such as calcium cations and humic acids on the size and charge of the PS-NPs with surface functional groups. Overall, PS-NP mobility in soil can vary widely, depending on PNP properties such as size and surface chemistry, and on matrix properties, such as the type of porous medium and its composition. These findings suggest that knowledge of inherent characteristics (size, surface charge, surface functional groups) of PNPs are required to elucidate the behavior of such particles in soil-water environments, and predict the extent of contaminant spreading.},

  abstract = {Phthalates are plasticizers that are added to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products to impart flexibility and durability. They are produced in high volume and generate extensive though poorly defined human exposures and unique childhood exposures. Phthalates are animal carcinogens and can cause fetal death, malformations, and reproductive toxicity in laboratory animals. Toxicity profiles and potency vary by specific phthalate. The extent of these toxicities and their applicability to humans remains incompletely characterized and controversial. Two phthalates, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP), have received considerable attention recently because of specific concerns about pediatric exposures. Like all phthalates, DEHP and DINP are ubiquitous contaminants in food, indoor air, soils, and sediments. DEHP is used in toys and medical devices. DINP is a major plasticizer used in children’s toys. Scientific panels, advocacy groups, and industry groups have analyzed the literature on DEHP and DINP and have come to different conclusions about their safety. The controversy exists because risk to humans must be extrapolated from animal data that demonstrate differences in toxicity by species, route of exposure, and age at exposure and because of persistent uncertainties in human exposure data. This report addresses sensitive endpoints of reproductive and developmental toxicity and the unique aspects of pediatric exposures to phthalates that generate concern. DEHP and DINP are used as specific examples to illustrate the controversy.},

In this paper, the toxic effects of nanoplastics on organisms were systematically reviewed. The translocation and absorption of nanoplastics, as well as the release of additives and contaminants adsorbed on nanoplastics in the organism body were discussed, and the potential adverse effects of nanoplastics on human health were evaluated. Nanoplastics can be ingested by organisms, be accumulated in their body and be transferred along the food chains. Nanoplastics showed effects on the growth, development and reproduction of organisms, and disturbing the normal metabolism. The toxic effects on living organisms mainly depended on the surface chemical properties and the particle size of nanoplastics. Positively charged nanoplastics showed more significant effects on the normal physiological activity of cells than negatively charged nanoplastics, and smaller particle sized nanoplastics could more easily penetrate the cell membranes, hence, accumulated in tissues and cells. Additionally, the release of additives and contaminants adsorbed on nanoplastics in organism body poses more significant threats to organisms than nanoplastics themselves. However, there are still knowledge gaps in the determination and quantification of nanoplastics, as well as their contaminant release mechanisms, degradation rates and process from large plastics to nanoplastics, and the transportation of nanoplastics along food chains. These challenges would hinder the risk assessment of nanoplastics in the environment. It is necessary to further develop the risk assessment of nanoplastics and deeply investigate its toxicological effects.},

Thermograms of polystyrene measured by this system (Py-EGA-MS) showed shifts of the peak temperature to the higher temperature region as the sample mass increased. It was found that the S/N ratios of EGA thermograms were 420-fold superior to those of differential thermogravimetry (DTG) thermograms for the same sample mass of 0.20~mg. Since a good linear relationship was obtained between peak temperatures obtained by Py-EGA-MS and DTG, it can be concluded that Py-EGA-MS can be used to obtain reliable data on thermal properties of samples with high sensitivity and using less sample.},

The presence of MP in the aquatic environment is related to several origins but particularly associated to their occurrence in wastewater effluents. The determination of MP in these complex samples is a challenge. Current analytical procedures for MP monitoring are based on separation and counting by visual observation or mediated with some type of microscopy with further identification by techniques such as Raman or Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In this work, a simple alternative for the separation, counting and identification of MP in wastewater samples is reported. The presented sample preparation technique with further polarized light optical microscopy (PLOM) observation positively identified the vast majority of MP particles occurring in wastewater samples of Montevideo, Uruguay, in the 70–600~μm range. MPs with different shapes and chemical composition were identified by PLOM and confirmed by confocal Raman microscopy. Rapid identification of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were evidenced. A major limitation was found in the identification of MP from non-birefringent polymers such as PVC (polyvinylchloride). The proposed procedure for MP analysis in wastewater is easy to be implemented at any analytical laboratory. A pilot monitoring of Montevideo WWTP effluents was carried out over 3-month period identifying MP from different chemical identities in the range 5.3–8.2\,×\,103 MP items/m3.},

  abstract = {Biological transformation of organic matter in soil is a crucial factor affecting the global carbon cycle. In order to understand these complex processes, soils must be investigated by a combination of various methods. This study compares the dynamics of biological mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) determined via CO2 evolution during an 80-day laboratory incubation with their thermo-oxidative stability determined by thermogravimetry (TG). Thirty-three soil samples, originating from a wide range of geological and vegetation conditions from various German national parks were studied. The results showed a correlation between the amount and rate of respired CO2 and thermal mass losses of air-dried, conditioned soils occurring around 100 °C with linear coefficients of determination up to R 2 = 0.85. Further, correlation of soil respiration with thermal mass losses around 260 °C confirmed previous observations. The comparison of TG profiles from incubated and non-incubated soils underlined the importance of thermal mass losses in these two temperature intervals. Incubated soils had reduced thermal mass losses above 240 °C and conversely an increased mass loss at 100–120 °C. Furthermore, the accurate determination of soil properties by TG such as soil organic carbon content was confirmed, and it was shown that it can be applied to a wider range of carbon contents as was previously thought. It was concluded that results of thermal analysis could be a helpful starting point for estimation of soil respiration and for development of methods revealing processes in soils.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in analytical methodology and computer modeling has significantly increased the knowledge about soil composition, processes, and functions. However, the complexity of soil processes hampers the development of globally applicable predictive models, which limits the practical assessment of soils under different land uses. This work focused on the identification of regional specific and generic soil properties toward the understanding global soil processes and functions by analyzing samples from contrasting climatic regions, parent materials, and land uses. Thermogravimetry was used as a primary method due to its ability to analyze whole soil samples including bound water and without the need for extraction or fractionation of soil components. A newly developed method was applied for mutual comparison of thermal mass losses and to search for relationships between soil components, which were assumed to be consequences of generic regulation processes established during soil formation. The results suggest the presence of soil regional-specific characteristics mainly between water binding and soil organic and inorganic matter components. As a common feature for all soils, a relationship between thermal mass losses was found, which can be explained as the influence of clay on water binding, accumulation of proteinaceous materials, and amount of organo-clay complexes. In addition, the applied approach supports the detection of generic soil forming processes in individual samples and is promising method to distinguish between organic carbon of pedogenetic origin from carbon of other sources such as charcoal or ash. Although, the underlying factors of these interrelations are not fully understood, thermogravimetry seems to be a helpful tool not only for simple screening of soil properties, but also for modeling underlying soil forming processes.},

The most important greenhouse gases are CO2, CH4 and N2O, with CH4 and N2O presenting global warming potentials 25 and 298 times higher than CO2, respectively. Most of the N2O emissions take place in soils and are related with agricultural activities. So, this review article aimed at presenting the mechanisms of N2O formation and emission in agricultural soils, as well as gathering and discussing information on how soil management practices may be used to reduce such emissions. The N2O formation in the soil occurs mainly through nitrification and denitrification processes, which are influenced by soil moisture, temperature, oxygen concentration, amount of available organic carbon and nitrogen and soil C/N ratio. Among these factors, those related to soil could be easily altered by management practices. Therefore, understanding the processes of N2O formation in soils and the factors influencing these emissions is fundamental to develop efficient strategies to reduce N2O emissions in agricultural soils.},

Microbial respiration in soils, especially those with increasing levels of organic matter, can augment solarization to produce soil temperatures higher than those achieved by solar heating alone. Currently, it is unclear how solarization affects microbial community structure in soils amended with organic matter to promote microbial activity. In this study, a field trial was conducted in the San Joaquin Valley of California to solarize an irrigated, agricultural field soil which was either amended with mature green waste compost destabilized with wheat bran, or not amended. Following 22 days of treatment during July–August 2011, soil from three depth increments (0–5.8, 5.8–11.6, and 11.6–17.4 cm) was subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to characterize microbial communities. The sequencing data obtained revealed similar microbial species richness and evenness in both solarized amended and non-amended soil. However, the taxonomic composition of communities differed by treatment. Furthermore, community structure within each treatment changed with soil depth, indicating potential enrichment of thermophilic bacteria in layers that experienced greatest heating, as well as changes related to alterations in the soil atmosphere. Certain bacteria detected in solarized, compost-amended soil may be relevant to agriculture and plant biomass deconstruction processes.},

Various types of organic matter may be incorporated into soil prior to solarization to increase biocidal activity of the treatment process. Microbial activity associated with the decomposition of soil organic matter may increase temperatures during solarization, potentially enhancing solarization efficacy. However, the level of organic matter decomposition (stability) necessary for increasing soil temperature is not well characterized, nor is it known if various amendments render the soil phytotoxic to crops following solarization. Laboratory studies and a field trial were performed to determine heat generation in soil amended with compost during solarization. Respiration was measured in amended soil samples prior to and following solarization as a function of soil depth. Additionally, phytotoxicity was estimated through measurement of germination and early growth of lettuce seedlings in greenhouse assays. Amendment of soil with 10\% (g/g) compost containing 16.9 mg CO2/g dry weight organic carbon resulted in soil temperatures that were 2–4 °C higher than soil alone. Approximately 85\% of total organic carbon within the amended soil was exhausted during 22 days of solarization. There was no significant difference in residual respiration with soil depth down to 17.4 cm. Although freshly amended soil proved highly inhibitory to lettuce seed germination and seedling growth, phytotoxicity was not detected in solarized amended soil after 22 days of field solarization.},

  abstract = {Amid the global plastic pollution crisis, a growing number of governments and nongovernmental actors are proposing a new global treaty. In February 2021, at the fifth meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)—the world's highest-level decision-making body on the environment—many governments spoke in favor of an international agreement to combat plastic pollution. In the past, the international community tended to view the plastics problem from a predominantly ocean-focused and waste-centered perspective. However, plastics are increasingly found in all environmental media, including terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, as well as human matrices, including lungs and placenta. We therefore argue for a new international legally binding agreement that addresses the entire life cycle of plastics, from extraction of raw materials to legacy plastic pollution. Only by taking this approach can efforts match the magnitude and transboundary nature of this escalating problem and its social, environmental, and economic impacts. Targeting the full life cycle of plastics allows for a more equitable distribution of the costs and benefits of relevant actions across the global value chain. Civil society organizations focusing on biodiversity conservation, health, climate change, and human rights have for years called for a binding global plastics agreement. In 2017, UNEA established the Ad Hoc Open-Ended Expert Group on Marine Litter and Microplastics, a group of international experts who have discussed options to address plastic pollution at a global level, on the basis that maintaining the status quo was not an option ([ 1 ][1]). Support for a legally binding global agreement now comes from at least 79 governments, who endorse the Oceans Day Plastic Pollution Declaration from 1 June 2021. Many civil society organizations, as well as a large coalition of major companies, have for years favored a UN treaty on plastic pollution ([ 2 ][2]). In May 2021, Peru and Rwanda announced they would table a resolution at the upcoming UNEA meeting in February 2022 to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee to begin developing such an agreement. The start of negotiations is overdue. In 2019, 368 million metric tons of newly made (or “virgin”) plastics were produced. Current solutions will not match the expected growth in plastics production and waste generation, even if massively scaled ([ 3 ][3]). In addition, the further increase in virgin plastics production could, by 2050, consume 10 to 13\% of the remaining global carbon budget permissible to keep global warming below a 1.5°C increase from preindustrial levels ([ 4 ][4]). Plastic pollution poses a considerable, even though not yet fully understood, threat to the environment, species, and habitats, as well as to cultural heritage. Its social impacts include harm to human health, in particular among vulnerable communities, and it comes with substantial economic costs affecting especially regions depending on tourism ([ 5 ][5]). Addressing these challenges requires a transformative approach that facilitates measures to reduce production of virgin plastic materials and includes equitable steps toward a safe and circular economy for plastics. \#\#\#\# Safe circularity principles The following principles provide guidance for developing criteria for the circularity of plastics: \#\#\#\#\# Durability Single-use plastics for which safe and environmentally sound alternatives exist are eliminated; and product design accommodates for safe reusability, repairability, and refillability \#\#\#\#\# Recyclability Recycling enables cost-effective material recovery with minimum energy loss and multiple recycling rounds without downcycling; and minimum threshold for recycled content agreed \#\#\#\#\# Safety Use of substances of concern eliminated; and use of primary microplastics eliminated and secondary releases minimized \#\#\#\#\# Transparency Labelling schemes guide informed choices; definitions are agreed including for “bioplastics” and “biodegradable plastics”; and information is available on the chemical content of products A binding treaty must be ambitious to eliminate the impacts of current amounts of plastic pollution and mitigate impacts of the projected increase in production in a business-as-usual scenario ([ 6 ][6]). An agreement should pursue a vision of zero plastic pollution and no harm to humans and the environment throughout the full life cycle of plastics. To realize this vision, negotiations will need to address the regulatory scope and architecture of the agreement, how it will complement and fill gaps in existing global and regional frameworks, and how the plastics value chain should be transformed, particularly in the “upstream” design and production phases. It is essential to involve all relevant stakeholders in negotiations and get them engaged in implementation efforts, from governments through producers and manufacturers, academia, civil society organizations and consumers, to the informal sector, including waste pickers. Based on a review of 20 global and 34 regional binding and voluntary instruments, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) concluded that the existing fragmented governance landscape is inadequate for addressing marine plastic pollution ([ 1 ][1]). Two major gaps underscore the need for a global agreement. First, there is a lack of a comprehensive global governance arrangement that addresses all sources of plastic pollution, in particular land-based. Most existing agreements are restricted to marine litter, especially sea-based sources, even though the majority of sources are located on land. For example, the London Convention and Protocol and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex V prohibits the discharge of garbage from ships into the sea. In addition, a range of nonbinding declarations and action plans aim at reducing marine plastic pollution, e.g., Sustainable Development Goal target 14.1. Regional seas conventions and action plans, regional fisheries management organizations, and other regional instruments focus on coordinated strategies to combat marine litter at sea-basin scale ([ 11 ][7]). Marine litter is also the focus of several UNEA resolutions as well as G7 and G20 Action Plans. Second, there is no global governance arrangement that addresses the entire life cycle of plastics. Many arrangements cover the waste phase but are weak on the design, production, and use phases ([ 1 ][1]). The gap in addressing the design and production phase is problematic because only 21\% of all plastics currently produced are theoretically recyclable, and a mere 15\% are actually recycled in practice ([ 8 ][8]). The international trade of plastic waste is regulated under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, which enjoys near-universal participation. Only clean, sorted plastic waste effectively destined for recycling can be freely traded, whereas mixed, contaminated, or hazardous plastic waste requires the prior informed consent of the importing country. Only the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants regulates the production phase of plastics, but this includes a limited set of prohibited chemicals that may no longer be used as additives. Most additives are therefore not addressed comprehensively under any international agreement, even though more than 1500 have been identified as chemicals of concern in plastics ([ 9 ][9]). Likewise, microplastics are addressed through a patchwork of national and regional initiatives instead of global regulations ([ 10 ][10], [ 11 ][7]). These gaps underscore the need for a legally binding global governance arrangement that would effectively and measurably limit and control plastic pollution ([ 1 ][1], [ 2 ][2], [ 12 ][11]). The governance failure manifests in various ways, entrenching the entire life cycle of plastics. It starts with the increasing production of virgin nonrenewable materials, and the manufacture of plastic products that are not designed for safe reusability and recyclability and which may be chemically contaminated. At the point of purchase, retailers and consumers are not informed about a product's chemical content and are faced with inconsistent and vague labeling (e.g., compostable, biodegradable, recyclable), leading to suboptimal end-of-life treatments. During use, the release of additives of concern and microplastics may negatively affect the health of consumers ([ 9 ][9]). And the most visible outcome is the rapidly increasing amount of macro- and microplastic waste in the environment. An international agreement that addresses these governance gaps and effectively combats pollution throughout the plastics life cycle and facilitates a sustainability-focused transformation needs to include three core goals (see the figure). \#\#\# Goal 1: Minimize virgin plastics production and consumption Controlling and minimizing plastic pollution first and foremost requires agreement on a progressively decreasing global production allowance for virgin plastics. Transformative scenarios that outline how plastic pollution can be prevented point toward the need to reduce virgin plastics production as a major contribution ([ 6 ][6], [ 8 ][8]). This goal is modeled after the Montreal Protocol, which sets a maximum level for production of ozone-depleting substances and progressively reduces volumes to safe levels ([ 7 ][12]). Similarly, the Paris Agreement sets a measurable goal for limiting the increase in the global average temperature, which can only be achieved by rapidly reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The former caps production by targeting inputs and the latter by focusing on outcomes. A cap is a powerful instrument that can be tailored to a specific challenge to incentivize action to reduce production and consumption and to find and use more benign alternatives. However, determining the volumes at which production and consumption should be capped will require robust knowledge of current and safe levels of pollution, environmentally sound and cost-effective alternative materials and processes, and a comprehensive tracking system of all materials, processes, and effectiveness of parallel measures undertaken. An agreed goal to reduce production and consumption of virgin plastic materials would send the clearest signal from governments to producers, consumers, and others along the plastics value chain. It is the key measure needed to reverse worsening trends. It would signal that manufacturers need to enhance their efforts toward sustainability of plastics considerably, that they will need to produce less of it, and that innovation and safety improvements offer substantial new market opportunities. The goal would also prevent GHG emissions by discouraging further investments in expanding plastics production capacities. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and the need to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the production and consumption targets should be aligned accordingly: By 2040, the use of virgin plastics should be largely phased out, and most plastic products should be made from recycled content to the extent possible. Exemptions should only be granted for materials like medical supplies for which no safe and nonplastic alternatives exist. The goal could be reached through a “start and strengthen” approach, first targeting the most problematic types of plastic that are difficult or impossible to recycle and for which alternatives can be easily applied. The agreement will need measures for phasing out or ultimately banning products using plastics (virgin or recycled) unnecessarily—i.e., when safe, affordable, and environmentally benign alternatives exist—and foster the development and use of such alternatives. There are many existing national and regional policy approaches on which to build and expand ([ 10 ][10]). With the Single Use Plastics Directive, the European Union (EU) follows the example of other states, including African and Small Island Developing States, and bans a range of throwaway products. A global plastics agreement should establish international norms to scale up such bans and other appropriate regulations. Demand for virgin plastics can be further reduced by setting a complementary progressively increasing consumption target for use of recycled content in products, which leads to the second core goal. \#\#\# Goal 2: Facilitate safe circularity of plastics A circularity goal for plastics will incentivize design for recycling, improve recycling rates, and foster the use of recycled content. Safe circularity can be achieved through elimination of hazardous substances. Reuse and refill systems, as well as alternative low-to-no waste delivery systems, also eliminate substantial volumes of plastic pollution and should be prioritized ahead of recycling. Measures to achieve these goals will help transform the value chain of plastics, bring competitive advantages to producers and retailers, create jobs, and provide health benefits to consumers and ecosystems. The agreement must establish binding technical standards for the design and recyclability of plastics. Hazardous additives, such as phthalates and bisphenols, must be phased out to ensure human safety and minimize impacts on wildlife populations ([ 9 ][9]). Chemical controls required by the agreement should include rules to share information on any potentially harmful additives along the value chain. Circularity will require a fundamental transformation of the plastics value chain, and though incurring costs, it could benefit all actors in the long term ([ 13 ][13]). In the upstream phases, the agreement must ensure a level playing field for producers and manufacturers through harmonized rules for product safety and sustainability, thus preventing companies from adhering to different standards. In the midstream phases, the agreement should set requirements and a legal basis for information sharing, establishing labeling and certification schemes and detailing harmonized definitions. This will enhance transparency on product contents and sustainability, and it will enable retailers and consumers to make informed choices that will help drive markets toward safe and sustainable products. It will also empower consumer organizations to sue producers and retailers that do not adhere to the strict sustainability and transparency standards. The general population will also benefit from increased product durability (including reuse, repair, and refill) and safety (less substances of concern in products). In the downstream phases, technical standards on plastic waste enshrined in the agreement will lead to benefits for recyclers, particularly low-income workers, from better-quality and higher residual value, leading to increased investment and job opportunities and improved livelihoods, especially for the informal sector. The legal basis for protecting the rights of the informal sector can be set in the agreement. Once hazardous chemicals are removed from the plastics life cycle, there are potentially substantial economic gains for the recycling industry ([ 2 ][2], [ 8 ][8], [ 13 ][13]). Furthermore, the population will be able to enjoy health benefits, including through reduced disposal of plastic waste in suboptimal conditions such as incineration, particularly open burning. To reach the goal, the agreement must define global criteria for the circularity of plastic products placed on global and domestic markets (see the box ). Such harmonized criteria will assist countries in adopting necessary regulatory, voluntary, and market-based measures ([ 12 ][11]). Extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes should be one of the mechanisms shifting the financial and physical burden of waste management to plastics producers and incentivizing design for circularity from the onset. Examples for circularity goals include the EU's strategy for plastics in a circular economy, which aims at all plastics packaging used in the EU to become reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030. The goal of facilitating circularity is closely linked with the global net reduction in consumption of both virgin polymers and chemical additives as per Goal 1. Currently there is a glaring gap between waste management capacities and waste production in many developing countries, but also in developed countries with regards to recycling capacity. Slowing the growth rate of plastic waste, and ultimately reducing total waste, reduces the need to scale waste management to meet the current growing demand. This is a key benefit of fostering transformation of production and consumption patterns, stimulating innovation toward “design for circularity,” and promoting systems for reuse, refill, repair, and recycling. \#\#\# Goal 3: Eliminate plastic pollution in the environment This goal aims to safely remove and sustainably dispose of plastics accumulated on land, on waterways, and in oceans. It also aims at preventing those plastics currently in use from ending up in the environment because of their low value at the end of life. Regarding the latter, the agreement should set strict pollution prevention targets, to be implemented at the national and subnational level, and based on analyses of plastic flows. This goal is designed to complement and scale up instruments already used at the national and regional level. Especially for developing countries, the lack of waste management services will require particular attention. Funding through the plastics agreement should be made available to establish and enhance the use of market-based instruments, including EPR schemes, to subsidize waste management and cleanup. For instance, the EU Single Use Plastics Directive applies EPR schemes to tobacco filters and fishing gear to cover the cost of cleaning up litter. Engaging in large-scale cleanup measures is a costly undertaking even if an effective agreement leads to reduced amounts of plastic waste entering the environment. For many nations and cities, it is advantageous to clean up polluted sites, because clogged waterways, drains, and sewers increase the risk of flooding and the spread of diseases. This will also redress reduced tourism revenues from polluted destinations. However, in other areas, there will only be limited economic incentives to clean up. For these areas, additional support measures are required. Such measures could include a fund dedicated to cleanup, requiring contributions from producers, which could fund citizen science audit and cleanup campaigns and repatriate plastics back to producer countries for responsible management. To effectively implement the agreement and follow up on its goals, concrete obligations, support measures, institutional arrangements, and mechanisms for strengthening nonstate action and for coordination with existing treaties need to be developed ([ 12 ][11]). \#\#\# Implementing and tracking progress A set of binding procedural obligations will help ensure that parties implement and stay on track with the agreement's goals. Countries will still need flexibility in the national pathways; hence, the agreement should include an obligation to develop and implement regularly updated national plastic pollution prevention plans (N4Ps). These must describe how countries endeavor to meet the core goals, based on national circumstances and capacities, and measures. They should contain ambitious and measurable national targets in line with the core goals. The plans must include all relevant measures to be taken by national and subnational governmental actors. They should be well-integrated into existing policies, legislation, and strategies and build on regionally coordinated plans or strategies, where in place. To ensure that the plans help meet the goals, common criteria should be defined for the contents of the plans, such as the setting of targets, determining baselines for various indicators, implementation time frames, and monitoring methodologies used. Moreover, following the model of the Paris Agreement, the agreement should ensure that N4Ps are progressive, reflecting increasing levels of ambition over time. The plans should also address previously identified main sources of leakage. For this, the preparation of national inventories on the production, consumption, trade, and end-of-life treatment is needed to assess leakage points across the value chain and to enable targeted interventions ([ 1 ][1]). These inventories can also be used for identifying hotspots of accumulation and assessing types of plastics and volumes found there, which can help determine the most cost-effective action. Another procedural obligation concerns regular reporting by parties on implementation and performance in achieving the core goals. Building on experiences in other agreements, reporting should use a format that requires quantitative and qualitative data that are considered meaningful. A secretariat to the convention will need to be established, which should support reporting ([ 12 ][11]). To ensure that the information provided by governments is comprehensive and to inform future policy-making, a transparent review mechanism for national reports should be included. In addition, countries would need to monitor the presence of plastic pollution in the environment to ensure that the three goals are delivering their intended impacts using harmonized methodologies that are practical, scalable, economically viable, and ecologically representative. Monitoring and assessment should address gaps and create synergies with existing programs at the local, national, and regional level ([ 11 ][7]). ![Figure][14]{$<$}/img{$>$} Core goals of a plastics agreementGRAPHIC: H. BISHOP/ SCIENCE  The preparation of a transparent and participatory iterative global review is needed to regularly inform parties of the effectiveness of the agreement. This could be achieved by aggregating data gathered through reporting on performance and monitoring impacts. Lastly, the agreement will also need a transparent compliance mechanism that allows parties to foster mutual implementation of its provisions and create a level playing field. At a minimum, it should help deal with cases of persistent noncompliance, as well as instances in which parties do not comply with their core procedural obligations of submitting regular N4Ps and reporting. More ambitiously, the agreement could explicitly state countries' right to prohibit imports of plastic products from noncompliant parties, because these pose an unacceptable social, environmental, and economic risk. \#\#\# Supporting mechanisms Supporting mechanisms are needed to give greater effect to other measures. Funding from both domestic budgets and private sources, coupled with international support, is needed to fund the necessary legislation, infrastructure, technology and capacity building. To have an impact, the agreement must include mechanisms to support developing countries in the implementation of measures committed to under the agreement, including for enabling activities, such as reporting and the development of N4Ps. This could include a dedicated funding mechanism, which could be managed by an existing body such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), or be a new fund. Entrusting the GEF would help to avoid proliferation of funding mechanisms and allow for synergies with the Facility's other focal areas, including chemicals and waste and climate change. The problem with the GEF is that it relies on voluntary contributions. The advantage of establishing a new fund is that it could be based on mandatory contributions using the UN scale of assessment that intends to accommodate a country's “capacity to pay,” resembling the Multilateral Fund for the Montreal Protocol. Additional voluntary funds could be established, inviting major producers of plastics and plastic products to contribute. Furthermore, a clearing-house mechanism could channel knowledge about existing funds and programs and assist developing countries in accessing them. Funds should be allocated to spur the use of market-based instruments, helping countries to internalize externalities of plastic pollution. Raising funds from plastics producers would align with the “polluter pays” principle and resemble a liability mechanism ([ 14 ][15]). It is important that the agreement ensures equity by helping countries to place the burden on the industry responsible for plastic pollution rather than the consumer. This can be achieved by encouraging the use of market-based instruments that target upstream measures, such as a levy on domestically produced virgin plastics, both generating funds and disincentivizing the excessive use of plastics. Ideally, these are earmarked levies channeled to fulfill the obligations of the agreement including by supporting research, development, and use of benign alternatives. At the national level, a plastics authority should be designated to ensure the implementation of the agreement. The authority would be responsible for translating the internationally agreed sustainability criteria to the national context. \#\#\# An evolving and inclusive framework Not all relevant aspects can be addressed in detail in the agreement itself. A framework for further action will be needed, as well as institutional arrangements to redevelop rules and implementation arrangements. This includes a governing body to convene the contracting parties to adopt decisions, annexes, and protocols where necessary, including technical standards and guidelines on design and production, reuse, recycling, disposal, and retrieval. In addition, subsidiary bodies would be established for areas where scientific and technical support is needed, including defining criteria for the safe circularity of plastics and developing and facilitating use of harmonized methodologies for data collection. A science-policy interface should support the transfer of knowledge between expert communities and policy-makers ([ 15 ][16]). Lastly, as the agreement is situated in a complex governance landscape, mechanisms would be needed to engage a wide array of societal actors and institutions. Specifically, a stakeholder engagement mechanism to facilitate nonstate and subnational action must support the agreement. This mechanism should include a global commitment platform where nonstate and subnational actors could announce voluntary commitments to be tracked and displayed online, and facilitate the organization of global and regional high-level events, technical dialogues, and other activities. These would allow learning from best-practice examples as well as from failures and to identify opportunities for upscaling ambition and action. A particular challenge will be to include the informal sector in the development and implementation of the agreement—for example, waste pickers as a major component of waste management systems in developing countries. In addition, the agreement would need a coordination mechanism for enhancing cooperation and synergies with existing other multilateral environmental agreements and relevant frameworks. The decision to launch an intergovernmental negotiating committee lies with the UNEA. The next decision-making meeting (UNEA 5.2) is scheduled for February 2022. A preparatory Ministerial Conference is scheduled for 1 to 2 September 2021 on invitation by Germany, Ghana, Ecuador, and Vietnam. It will take several years for a new agreement to be negotiated, enter into force, and begin to have an impact. Hence, it is necessary to continuously develop and strengthen action through existing regional and multilateral institutions. Yet governments need to boldly go beyond existing approaches. Although a new agreement will come with costs, it will unlock sizable environmental, social, and economic benefits ([ 2 ][2], [ 8 ][8], [ 13 ][13]). 1.  [↵][17]U. N.

It discusses the issue that particle number is not a conserved base quantity and hence less suited than mass to compare independent studies on MP in the environment. It concludes that MP mass should be included when quantifying MP pollution in the environment, supplementing the conventional approach of reporting particle numbers. Applying mass as the unit of MP measurement, the paper presents data showing that Danish wastewater treatment plants discharge around 3 t/year of MP in the size range 10–500 μm. This value corresponds to an annual per capita emission from these plants of 0.56 g MP/(capita year). The distribution of polymer types by mass and particle number differed because the size of MP particles of the different material types varied.},

A focal plane array-based Fourier transform infrared imaging technique enabled MP quantification and an in-house-built software (MPhunter) facilitated automatic analysis of the obtained infrared spectra. The disc filter retained 89.7\% of particles, and 75.6\% of their mass. This removal efficiency is comparable to removal rates reported by previous studies. However, the presence of an unexpectedly large number of MP particles whose size substantially exceeded the pore size of the disc filter suggests that particles could either bypass or pass through the filter mesh, somewhat diminishing the performance of the filter. The concentration of MPs in the effluent was 3 MP/L, corresponding to an estimated mass concentration of 0.31 \&micro;g/L. The annual MP discharge from the studied WWTP after the disc filter was estimated to be 1.1 kg in 2017. It was hence not a significant contributor to MP emissions in Denmark. Although the operation of the disc filter seems to have been disturbed, it nonetheless achieved a high MP removal rate. Therefore, we conclude that it is a suitable technology to decrease the concentration of discharged MPs in wastewater effluents.},

This technology is not only helping to alleviate the issue of climate change but also helping farmers to increase yield, thereby high economic returns for the better quality produce. Challenges faced for commercialization of plastic mulches were lack of mechanization and intensive labour requirement. Tractor mounted mulch laying machine acquired reasonable acceptance in the developed world while its adaptation was limited in developing world particularly South East Asia. Benefit cost analysis of adapting mulch laying machine for viable use was done. Three options such as manual, partially mechanized, and mechanized process of mulch laying were analyzed. The analysis revealed that total operational cost of the machine is INR Rs. 2129/ (\$ 36) per hectare with saving of 31.78 \% with partially mechanized (Bed planter + Manual Mulch + Manual Drip Laying) and 68.8 \% with completely manual operation. Plastic mulching machine also saves 81.43 \% and 95.20 \% labour over partially mechanized operation and completely manual operation respectively.},

Biodegradable plastic is a promising alternative to conventional plastic. However, biodegradable plastics must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that they undergo complete degradation and have no adverse impact on the environment. We evaluated the degradation of biodegradable plastics during 18-week full-scale composting, and determined whether additives from the plastics are released upon degradation. Two biodegradable plastic films—one containing polybutylene co-adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT) and the other containing polylactic acid/poly-hydroxy−alkanoate (PLA/PHA)—were placed into meshbags and buried in the compost. Degradation was assessed by image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, electrophoretic mobility, δ13C isotope analyses, and single particle mass spectrometry of mulch fragments. The results showed N99\% macroscopic degradation of PLA/PHA and 97\% for PBAT film. Polymers in the biodegradable films degraded; however, micro- and nanoparticles, most likely carbon black, were observed on the meshbags. Overall, biodegradable plastics hold promise, but the release of micro- and nanoparticles from biodegradable plastic upon degradation warrants additional investigation and calls for longer field testing to ensure that either complete biodegradation occurs or that no long-term harm to the environment is caused.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of new generation plastics has been accompanied by the development of standard methods for studying their biodegradability. Generally, test methods are based on the measurement of CO2 production, i.e. the mineralization degree of the tested materials. However, in order to describe the biodegradation process, the determination of the residual amount of tested material which remains in the environment and its chemical characterization can be very important. In this study, the biodegradation in soil of a model polyester (poly(butylene sebacate)) was monitored. Gel Permeation Chromatography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (31P-NMR and 1H-NMR) were used in order to obtain information about the polyester structure and the possible by-products that can be found in soil during and at the end of the incubation. The polyester mineralization (i.e. the CO2 production) was tested according to ASTM 5988 standard method for 245 days. When the polyester mineralization was about 21\% and 37\% (after 78 and 140 days of incubation) and at the end of the process (63\% of mineralization, 100\% if compared to the cellulose used as reference material), the soil was extracted with chloroform (solvent of the tested substance) and the extracts were analyzed using GPC and NMR acquisitions. The analytical acquisitions showed high molecular weight polyester in soil during the incubation (78 and 140 days): the polyester concentration decreased but its structure remained almost the same with a slow decreasing in molecular weight. At the end of the test (245 days) no film of the polyester could be extracted from the soil: NMR acquisitions and GPC analyses of the extracts suggested a strong degraded structure of the residual polyester. Even if at the end of the process only 63\% of carbon had been lost by mineralization, the whole of the added polyester seems to have disappeared after about eight months of incubation, suggesting substantial biomass formation.},

Ironically, the most preferred property of plastics – durability – exerts also the major environmental threat. Recycling has practically failed to provide a safe solution for disposal of plastic waste (only 5\% out of 1 trillion plastic bags, annually produced in the US alone, are being recycled). Since the most utilized plastic is polyethylene (PE; ca. 140 million tons/year), any reduction in the accumulation of PE waste alone would have a major impact on the overall reduction of the plastic waste in the environment. Since PE is considered to be practically inert, efforts were made to isolate unique microorganisms capable of utilizing synthetic polymers. Recent data showed that biodegradation of plastic waste with selected microbial strains became a viable solution.},

  abstract = {Since the 1900s, the link between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit from viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Soil disturbance from tillage is a major cause of organic matter depletion and reduction in the number and stability of soil aggregates when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture. No-till (NT) cropping systems usually exhibit increased aggregation and soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the extent of soil organic matter changes in response to NT management varies between soils and the mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in NT systems are unclear. We evaluated a conceptual model which links the turnover of aggregates to soil organic matter dynamics in NT and CT systems; we argue that the rate of macroaggregate formation and degradation (i.e. aggregate turnover) is reduced under NT compared to CT and leads to a formation of stable microaggregates in which carbon is stabilized and sequestered in the long term. Therefore, the link between macroaggregate turnover, microaggregate formation, and C stabilization within microaggregates partly determines the observed soil organic matter increases under NT.},

In this study, we wanted to assess the sources (plants or microbes; fungi or bacteria) and degree of microbial alteration of (i) three particulate organic matter fractions – namely the free light fraction (1.85~g cm−3), the coarse (250–2000~μm) and the fine (53–250~μm) intra-aggregate particulate organic matter fractions – and of (ii) three density fractions of fine-silt associated carbon – namely {$<\mkern1mu$}2.0, 2.0–2.2 (i.e. enriched labile fraction) and {$>\mkern1mu$}2.2~g cm−3– by analysing the amino sugars, by CuO oxidation analyses, and by 13C-, 1H- and 31P-NMR analyses. Macroaggregates (250–2000~μm) were separated by wet-sieving from a former grassland soil now under a no-tillage arable regime. The three particulate organic matter fractions and the three density fractions were isolated from the macroaggregates by a combination of density flotation, sonication and sieving techniques. Proton NMR spectroscopy on alkaline extracts showed that the enriched labile fraction is not of microbial origin but is strongly degraded plant material that is enriched in aliphatic moieties partly bound to aromatics. In addition, the enriched labile fraction had a glucosamine content less than the whole soil, indicating that it is not enriched in carbon derived from fungi. Decreasing yields of phenolic CuO oxidation products and increasing side-chain oxidation in the order coarse intra-aggregate particulate organic matter {$<$} fine inter-aggregate particulate organic matter {$<$} fine-silt fractions indicate progressive alteration of lignin as particle size decreases. The light fraction was more decomposed than the coarse inter-aggregate particulate organic matter, as indicated by (i) its larger ratio of acid-to-aldehyde of the vanillyl units released by CuO oxidation, (ii) the smaller contribution of H in carbohydrates to total extractable H as estimated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, and (iii) a larger contribution of monoester P to total extractable P in the 31P-NMR spectra. In conclusion, the four fractions are derived predominantly from plants, but microbial alteration increased as follows: coarse inter-aggregate particulate organic matter {$<$} light fraction ≈ fine inter-aggregate particulate organic matter {$<$} enriched labile fraction.},

The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53–250 μm sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs.},

Organic mulches reduced total weed counts by 50\% compared to control plots. and underlaying organic mulches with polyethylene resulted in complete control. Polypropylene, used in combination with organic mulch, was ineffective in controlling perennial weed species. Pine bark was the most durable organic mulch, requiring the least replenishment (70\% initial volume) after 630 days. Durability of organic mulches increased when underlaid with polyethylene. Longleaf pine needles were rated most attractive, and underlying organic materials with either polyethylene or polypropylene enhanced appearance. Organic mulches reduced maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface by 2.2–3.3°C (4–6°F) and increased minimum daily temperatures by 1.1–2.2°C (2–4°F).

The equilibrium concentration of HOC in the polymer can be measured and then converted into equilibrium concentrations in other (defined) media, which however requires appropriate polymer to media partition coefficients. We determined thus polymer-lipid partition coefficients (KPL) of various PCB, PAH and organochlorine pesticides by equilibration of two silicones and low density polyethylene (LDPE) with fish oil and Triolein at 4~°C and 20~°C. We observed (i) that KPL was largely independent of lipid type and temperature, (ii) that lipid diffusion rates in the polymers were higher compared to predictions based on their molecular volume, (iii) that silicones showed higher lipid diffusion and lower lipid sorption compared to LDPE and (iv) that absorbed lipid behaved like a co-solute and did not affect the partitioning of HOC at least for the smaller molecular size HOC. The obtained KPL can convert measured equilibrium concentrations in passive sampling polymers into equilibrium concentrations in lipid, which then can be used (1) for environmental quality monitoring and assessment, (2) for thermodynamic exposure assessment and (3) for assessing the linkage between passive sampling and the traditionally measured lipid-normalized concentrations in biota. LDPE-lipid partition coefficients may also be of use for a thermodynamically sound risk assessment of HOC contained in microplastics.},

The GC?MS analysis proved the formation of C?C and C?O dimers, whereas the ESI?MS/MS analysis also suggested trimerization for all the monomers and tetramerization for CAT. On the basis of mass spectra, molecular structures were assigned to the observed oligomers. In the phenolic separate solutions, dimers represented about 65\%, 44\%, and 30\% of reaction products for CAT, CAFF, and COUM, respectively, whereas trimers were from 4 to 5\%. A relevant part of the products were unidentified oligomers and several degradation compounds, mostly aromatic aldehydes and alcohols and aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids. When all three humic phenolic monomers underwent the catalyzed coupling reaction in one mixed solution, 14\% of the reaction products were identified as C?C dimers of CAT. Although no other C?O dimers of CAT, nor any dimers of COUM and CAFF, could be identified, some other structurally unknown oligomers were present among the reaction products of the mixed solution. However, no oligomers larger than tetramers were formed in either separate or mixed solutions. This work indicates the essential role of biomimetic metal?porphyrins in catalyzing the oxidative coupling of humic phenolic monomers in aqueous media, thereby promoting the polymerization of natural organic matter.},

However, reported effectiveness of mulch covers varies widely and there are indications that spatial measurement scale (i.e. plot length) explains part of this variability. The objective of this study is therefore to analyse the impacts of plot length at which field and laboratory experiments were conducted on the effectiveness of mulch covers in reducing soil loss by water erosion. In this review, 41 studies investigating the impacts of mulch cover on soil erosion by water are analysed (plot length ranges between 0.1 and 30.5~m). Calculated mulch effectiveness factors, i.e. b-values from the mulch factor equation, range between 0.0097 and 0.1320 and increase linearly with plot length for the reviewed experiments: b = 0.022 + 0.0017 ⁎ plot\_length (m); R2 = 0.37; n = 41. However, care should be taken when using this relationship for extrapolations to longer plots. Furthermore, slope gradient, soil type and mulch type determine the variability of the effectiveness of mulch covers in reducing soil erosion rates by water. Depending on the dominant soil erosion process (i.e. splash, interrill, rill and interrill or rill erosion), these variables also partly control the effectiveness of a mulch cover in reducing soil erosion by water.},

  abstract = {Plastics have become an essential material of the modern global consumer economy, yet many of the properties that make them useful in so many applications also make them a serious environmental threat. As for much new technology, their development and proliferation occurred with little consideration for their impacts, but now it is impossible to deny their dark side as we confront a rapidly growing plastic pollution problem. In this special issue, we examine a range of topics related to plastics, from their distribution in the environment to their development into an evolutionary trap for animals to ways we can rethink them to create a better future. A series of Reviews discusses how plastics are best understood as novel geomaterials, the evolutionary and ecological dimensions of plastic ingestion by wildlife, the accumulation and effects of plastic pollution in the environment, and how innovations in upcycling and recycling may affect the fate of plastics and drive advances in next-generation materials design. Complementing these Reviews, a Policy Forum and a pair of Perspectives discuss efforts to develop a global agreement to combat plastic pollution, provide an overview of the history of environmental bioplastics and their implications, and offer suggestions for designing plastics for a circular bioeconomy. Finally, a brace of News Features explores how enzymes are being used to aid in plastic recycling efforts and how museums are trying to stop plastics in their exhibits from breaking down. The time for preventing plastic pollution is long past—the time for changing the future of plastics in our world, however, is now. ![Figure][1]{$<$}/img{$>$} Impacts of plastic waste on marine speciesPHOTO: NASTCO/ISTOCKPHOTO; GRAPHIC: K.

Net N mineralization was greater from the heavy fraction than from the whole soil of most sites perhaps because the light fraction immobilized N released from the heavy fraction when they were incubated together.

Stabilization of a portion of the litter C yields material that resists further transformation; destabilization yields material that is more susceptible to microbial respiration. Stability of the organic C is viewed as resulting from three general sets of characteristics. Recalcitrance comprises molecular-level characteristics of organic substances, including elemental composition, presence of functional groups, and molecular conformation, that influence their degradation by microbes and enzymes. Interactions refers to the inter-molecular interactions between organics and either inorganic substances or other organic substances that alter the rate of degradation of those organics or synthesis of new organics. Accessibility refers to the location of organic substances with respect to microbes and enzymes. Mechanisms by which these three characteristics change through time are reviewed along with controls on those mechanisms. This review suggests that the following changes in the study of soil organic matter dynamics would speed progress: (1) increased effort to incorporate results into budgets for whole soil (e.g., converting to a kg/ha basis) so that the relative importance of processes can be judged; (2) more attention to effects of inter-molecular interactions (especially Al complexation) on enzyme activity and substrate degradation; (3) increased effort to experimentally manipulate soils, preferably across a range of soil types; (4) study of stabilization and destabilization mechanisms under conditions that are well defined yet more relevant to soil environments than those used previously; and (5) experiments better designed to isolate mechanisms so results are not confounded by effects of other mechanisms operating simultaneously.},

To determine whether MFs are harmful for soil biota, we evaluated toxic effects on terrestrial snails (Achatina fulica) after 28 d exposure to polyethylene terephthalate MFs at concentrations of 0.01–0.71 g kg−1 (dry soil weight). Digestion kinetics experiments on 24 snails showed that MFs can be ingested and excreted within 48 h. We found the appearance of cracks and deterioration on the surface of MFs after depuration by the digestive system. Prolonged exposure to 40 snails showed that 0.14–0.71 g kg−1 MFs caused an average reduction of 24.7–34.9\% food intake and 46.6–69.7\% excretion. 0.71 g kg−1 MFs induced significant villi damage in the gastrointestinal walls of 40\% snails, but did not influence the histology of the liver and kidney. Moreover, 0.71 g kg−1 MFs exposure reduced glutathione peroxidase (59.3 ± 13.8\%) and total antioxidant capacity (36.7 ± 8.5\%), but elevated malondialdehyde level (58.0 ± 6.4\%) in the liver, which indicates oxidative stress is involved in the toxic mechanism. Our results suggest that MFs have adverse impacts on the fitness of soil organisms, and highlight the ecological risks of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.},

In years 2002, 2003 and 2005 experiments were conducted to study the impact of soil mulching with black polyethylene on Akord F1 cucumber yields. Plants were cultivated on sandy loam soil using irrigation and fertigation applied with the assistance of drip lines. No significant differences were observed in levels of total and marketable yields of fruits as well as in dry matter and total carbohydrate contents in fruits obtained from plants cultivated in mulched and unmulched soils. Irrigation efficiency, on the soil mulched with black polyethylene was higher than on the soil without mulching.},

At the beginning of lithogenesis, rocks are formed through crystallization when the molten magma cools down. They are subject to further diverse changes through the processes of weathering, erosion, transport, deposition, diagenesis, metamorphism and anatexis, which are connected to one another in a cycle. Soils are a significant station in this cycle. On the one hand, they are the result of the transformation of rock in contact with the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere (pedogenesis), and on the other, they deliver material for the formation of new rocks. For this reason, soils cannot be understood and classified without knowledge of the rocks; however, the same is true for many rocks without knowledge of the soils (Kittrick 1985).},

  abstract = {A comprehensive and critical review was performed on the environmental fate of eighteen commercial phthalate esters with alkyl chains ranging from 1 to 13 carbons. A synthesis of the extensive literature data on physicochemical properties, partitioning behavior, abiotic and biotic transformations and bioaccumulation processes of these chemicals is presented. This chemical class exhibits an eight order of magnitude increase in octanol-water partition coefficients (Kow) and a four order of magnitude decrease in vapor pressure (VP) as alkyl chain length increases from 1 to 13 carbons. A critical review of water solubility measurements for higher molecular weight phthalate esters (i.e. alkyl chains ≥ 6 carbons) reveals that most published values exceed true water solubilities due to experimental difficulties associated with solubility determinations for these hydrophobic organic liquids. Laboratory and field studies show that partitioning to suspended solids, soils, sediments and aerosols increase as Kow increases and VP decreases. Photodegradation via free radical attack is expected to be the dominant degradation pathway in the atmosphere with predicted half-lives of ca. 1 day for most of the phthalate esters investigated. Numerous studies indicate that phthalate esters are degraded by a wide range of bacteria and actinomycetes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Standardized aerobic biodegradation tests with sewage sludge inocula show that phthalate esters undergo ≥ 50\% ultimate degradation within 28 days. Biodegradation is expected to be the dominant loss mechanism in surface waters, soils and sediments. Primary degradation half-lives in surface and marine waters range from \&lt;1 day to 2 weeks and in soils from \&lt;1 week to several months. Longer half-lives may occur in anaerobic, oligotrophic, or cold environments. Numerous experiments have shown that the bioaccumulation of phthalate esters in the aquatic and terrestrial foodchein is limited by biotransformation, which increases with increasing trophic level. Consequently, models that ignore biotransformation grossly exaggerate bioaccumulation potential of higher molecular weight phthalate esters. This review provides the logical first step in elucidating multimedia exposure to phthalate esters.},

The MS signal calibration in relation to the flow stability through TG-MS interface was examined. The influence of the TG furnace temperature on MS signal, and the effects of heat and mass transfer phenomena were also discussed. Furthermore, the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the fire retardant compounds on cellulose pyrolysis were examined. Both fire retardant compounds resulted in the increase of the non-combustible pyrolysis products, such as H2O and CO2, and char. Low levels of levoglucosan were recorded. It appears that in the presence of the fire retardant compounds a relative increase of levoglucosenone in the evolved gases is observed. Finally, the effects of the fire retardants on the pyrolysis mechanism were discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Agricultural plastic covers made from polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) offer increased yields and an improved crop quality. However, such covers are suspected of partially breaking down into smaller debris and thereby contributing to soil pollution with microplastics. To scrutinize this, we randomly sampled 240 topsoil cores (0–5\,cm) from eight fields covered with fleeces, perforated foils, and plastic mulches for less than two years. Samples from the field periphery (50\,m perimeter) served as reference. Visual plastic debris {$>$}\,2\,mm was analyzed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (FTIR–ATR). Smaller, soil-associated plastic debris was dispersed from 50\,g of fine soil (≤\,2\,mm) using sodium hexametaphosphate solution and density-separated with saturated NaCl solution. The collected PE, PP, and polystyrene (PS) debris was selectively dissolved in a mixture of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and p-xylene at 150\,°C and quantified by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). We counted six PE and PS fragments {$>$}\,2\,mm in two out of eight fields. By contrast, Py-GC/MS analysis revealed PE, PP, and PS contents {$>$}\,1\,µg\,g−1 in seven fields (17\,\% of all samples). In three fields, PE levels of 3–35\,µg\,g−1 were associated with the use of thinner and less durable perforated foils (40\,µm thickness). This was slightly more pronounced at field edges where the plastic covers are turned and weighted down. By contrast, 50\,µm thick PE films were not indicated to emit any plastic debris. PP contents of 5–10\,µg\,g−1 were restricted to single observations in the field centers of three sites. On one site, we found expanded PS particles {$>$}2\,mm that concurred with elevated PS levels (8–19\,µg\,g−1) in the fine soil. Both PP and PS were distributed indistinctly across sites so that their source remained unresolved. In addition, the extent to which plastic contents of up to 7\,µg\,g−1 in the field periphery of some sites were attributed to wind drift from the covered fields or from external sources needs to be investigated in future studies. Yet, our results suggest that the short-term use of thicker and more durable plastic covers should be preferred to limit plastic emissions and accumulation in soil.},

  abstract = {Plastic mulching has become a globally applied agricultural practice for its instant economic benefits such as higher yields, earlier harvests, improved fruit quality and increased water-use efficiency. However, knowledge of the sustainability of plastic mulching remains vague in terms of both an environmental and agronomic perspective. This review critically discusses the current understanding of the environmental impact of plastic mulch use by linking knowledge of agricultural benefits and research on the life cycle of plastic mulches with direct and indirect implications for long-term soil quality and ecosystem services. Adverse effects may arise from plastic additives, enhanced pesticide runoff and plastic residues likely to fragment into microplastics but remaining chemically intact and accumulating in soil where they can successively sorb agrochemicals. The quantification of microplastics in soil remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate analytical techniques. The cost and effort of recovering and recycling used mulching films may offset the aforementioned benefits in the long term. However, comparative and long-term agronomic assessments have not yet been conducted. Furthermore, plastic mulches have the potential to alter soil quality by shifting the edaphic biocoenosis (e.g. towards mycotoxigenic fungi), accelerate C/N metabolism eventually depleting soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellency and favour the release of greenhouse gases. A substantial process understanding of the interactions between the soil microclimate, water supply and biological activity under plastic mulches is still lacking but required to estimate potential risks for long-term soil quality. Currently, farmers mostly base their decision to apply plastic mulches rather on expected short-term benefits than on the consideration of long-term consequences. Future interdisciplinary research should therefore gain a deeper understanding of the incentives for farmers and public perception from both a psychological and economic perspective in order to develop new support strategies for the transition into a more environment-friendly food production.},

Thus, the development of ecologically sound, economically sustainable cultural management strategies for tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) production is needed. Two plantings were made within each of the three tomato harvest seasons [summer, bridge (late summer) and fail] in 1998 and 1999 (one summer crop in 1999). Between-bed treatments included clean culture or pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum(L.) R. Br.] sown at bed establishment. On-bed treatments included standard plasticulture with fumigation on a 76-cm-wide bed (std), plasticulture without fumigation on a 76-cm-wide bed (std-fum), plasticulture on a 61-cm-bed with fumigation (narrow) and organic mulch [wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.) in 1998; desiccated hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) in 1999]. Total and marketable yields for the three plasticulture on-bed treatments (std, std-fum and narrow) were similar in 1998 and 1999. Yield was suppressed for the organic mulch on-bed treatments in all but the bridge plantings in 1999. Improved yield with plasticulture treatments and high market price for the summer crop in 1998 resulted in elevated crop value and return to land and management (return) compared to that of organic mulch. The return for later plantings was low, but positive. Return was negative for both bridge and the first fall crops in organic mulch in 1998. Low yields in all treatments and low prices in 1999 resulted in negative to negligible return for on-bed treatments in all but the summer planting using plasticulture. Return was consistently lower with organic mulch compared to plasticulture for the hi value summer crop in Virginia with between-bed millet in 1998 and with or without millet in 1999. The use of organic mulch on the beds in this study was not economically feasible for the high value summer crops. Adjustments (desiccation of cover, control of weeds) in cultural management of the between-bed management strategy are needed before large-scale commercial implementation will occur.},

We do know that they are practical and cheap--but they also represent a huge environmental problem, for they literally take ages to decompose. In this engaging book, E.S. Stevens tells us everything we have always wondered about plastics and of the efforts, in America, Europe, and Asia, to develop a new breed of environmentally friendly plastics. He points to a possible future where plastics will no longer be made of petroleum, but of plants.  The first two chapters assess the increased use of plastics as a relatively new alternative to other materials. The third chapter introduces us to their impact on the environment and strategies for their disposal or recycling. The next two chapters cover basic concepts and terms used in polymer sciences and provide some basic chemistry. With these fundamentals in tow, the author compares how petroleum-based and biological polymers are made, and the various ways in which they decompose. He acquaints readers with the emerging technologies, their commercial viability, and their future. Finally, instructions are given for preparing basic bioplastics using readily available materials.  Nonspecialists will find Green Plastics a concise introduction to this exciting interdisciplinary topic--an introduction otherwise not available. For students it provides easy entry to an area of science with wide appeal and current importance; for teachers, excellent background reading for courses in various sciences. The prospect of depleted fossil fuel supplies, and the potential benefits of bioplastics to the environment and to rural areas that could supply the raw materials, make this book a compelling presentation of a subject whose time has come.},

The systems were tested using a single cultivar, Allstar, to avoid treatment x cultivar interaction. System-specific management operations and materials affected the total production costs of each system. Both CMR and AMR had higher management costs than CCP as a result of labor costs for weed control, but CCP had much higher cost of materials. Overall expenses were lowest for CMR and highest for AMR. Yields in the first fruiting year were highest for CM R at 17.4 Mg.ha(-1) followed by AMR and CCP at 13.2 Mg.ha(-1) and 11.8 Mg.ha(-1), respectively. In the 2004 harvest season, CMR and AMR were the highest yielding at 10.0 Mg.ha(-1) and 9.0 Mg.ha(-1), respectively, with CCP the lowest yielding at 6.0 Mg.ha(-1). Low yield and fruit size in the second year and high material costs for establishment limit the economic viability for CCP when managed as a perennial system.}

  abstract = {Modifications to the capsicum farming system (adding an organic amendment and replacing the standard plastic mulch with a layer of plant residue) were assessed for their potential to reduce losses from soilborne diseases. An amendment of sugarcane residue (12.5 t dry matter/ha) plus ammonium nitrate (100 kg N/ha) incorporated 4 months before planting capsicum enhanced microbial activity, increased numbers of free-living nematodes, decreased populations of rootknot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) and reduced the severity of galling caused by the nematode. The amendment also reduced the severity of Pythium root rot caused by Pythium aphanidermatum, while a similar effect was obtained in a pot experiment with Pythium myriotylum. Damage from Pythium root rot was more severe in plastic-covered beds than in beds mulched with plant residue, probably because the organic mulch reduced soil temperatures by as much as 12°C. Mulching with plant residue also changed the pest and disease spectrum because it increased losses from cutworms (larvae of Agrostis sp.) and the severity of a leaf spot disease caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. The organic mulch also reduced fruit yield, largely because heavy rainfall leached nutrients (particularly N, K, Ca and Mg) from beds that were not covered with plastic. These results indicate that organic amendments and mulches have the potential to reduce losses from soilborne diseases in vegetable crops, provided plant nutrition can be managed satisfactorily when beds are mulched with organic matter.},

Several methods are used for sampling and sample preparation (e.g., organic digestion and density separation) which influence the interpretation of results and hamper their comparability. The results clearly show that the basis for the interpretation of the results of microplastic monitoring is the consistency of a sampling strategy.

Selecting intensely coloured particles and fibres, we find lower limits of the microplastic concentrations of 0–7particles/kg and 2–11fibres/kg dry sediment. The largest microplastic contaminations are measured at the Peene outlet into the Baltic Sea and in the North Sea Jade Bay.

Practical problems in dealing with the invertebrate fauna include sampling, taxonomy and availability of biological information on species. Various measures are available that use invertebrates to assess soil quality, each with its advantages and disadvantages. They include abundance, biomass, density, species richness, trophic/guild structure, food web structure, keystone species and ecosystem engineers.

In order to attain this purpose, eight demographic measures, tapping familiarity, subculture and expertise, were developed. Serving as criterion variables, sumscores were constructed on the basis of a nonmetric factorial analysis (SSA-III), identifying seven perceptual dimensions in the visual preferences for agrarian landscapes. The results suggest areas of unanimity as well as areas of divergence with respect to the visual perception of agrarian landscapes. Thus, an almost unanimous consensus with respect to (a) the high preferences for traditional human-influenced settings and nature scenes, and (b) the relative dislike for dominating human influence and many of the effects of modern farming practices was found. In contrast, important divergencies were found for landscape categories in the moderate preference range, with the highest occurrence of group differences for a category of scenes depicting farming activities. The most potent demographic predictors of preference across landscape categories were present population density, gender, organization membership and expertise. In addition, effects of age and present geographical region of residence were observed. The findings support evidence from earlier analyses of the landscapes in question, indicating strong preferences for traditional agrarian settings.},

In particular, environmental and fertiliser legislation relevant to soil protection in the European Union and in Germany are assessed. Regulatory weaknesses and gaps of the respective legislation are identified, and proposals for enhanced command-and-control provisions developed. However, the legal analysis furthermore shows that plastic pollution ecologically is also a problem of quantity, which is difficult to solve exclusively through command-and-control legislation. Instead, comprehensive quantity-control instruments to phase out fossil fuels (worldwide and in all sectors) as required by climate protection law can be effective approaches to tackle plastic pollution in environmental media like agricultural soils as well.},

The soil physical properties such as rate of water loss/day, soil bulk density, percentage of pore space and hydraulic conductivity were also favourably influenced by the polyethylene film mulch. The data on soil available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK), showed that effect of polyethylene film mulch was significant at 30 DAS and not during later stages during both the seasons. Similarly the evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) (soil respiration) was also significantly improved by polyethylene film mulch. The effect of land configuration was not significant for most of the parameters observed except for bulk density and pore space during winter seasons. With regard to yield parameters and yield, in both the seasons, white polyethylene film mulch out yielded other treatments in terms of groundnut pod yield.

However, the weed control efficiency did not differ much between the black and herbicidal polyethylene film mulch in the later stages. Though black polyethylene film mulch excelled the other treatments in weed control, the same was not reflected in the growth and yield parameters due to its poor soil-warming efficiency. Leaf chlorophyll concentration was higher with black polyethylene mulch though it was at par with other plastic mulches at all the stages. The increased number of pods/plant, number of seeds/pod and seed yield with herbicidal plastic mulches indicated that herbicidal plastic mulch could improve the rapeseed production through better weed control.},

The current procedures for microplastic extraction from sludge are time consuming and require expensive reagents for density separation as well as large volumes of oxidizing agents for organic removal, often resulting in tiny sample sizes and thus a disproportional risk of sample bias. In this work, we present an improved extraction method tested on return activated sludge (RAS). The treatment of 100 ml of RAS requires only 6\% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for bleaching at 70 °C, followed by density separation with sodium nitrate/sodium thiosulfate (SNT) solution, and is completed within 24 h. Extracted particles of all sizes were chemically analyzed with confocal Raman microscopy. An extraction efficiency of 78 ± 8\% for plastic particle sizes 20 µm and up was confirmed in a recovery experiment. However, glass shards with a diameter of less than 20 µm remained in the sample despite the density of glass exceeding the density of the separating SNT solution by 1.1 g/cm3. This indicates that density separation may be unreliable for particle sizes in the lower micrometer range.},

Thermal analysis methods are generally not considered a method of choice for MPs analysis, especially in aqueous samples due to limited sample size introduction to the instrument, decreasing the detection levels. In this article, pyrolysis - Gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-GCToF) is used as a method of choice for detection of MPs and NPs due to its unprecedented detection capabilities, in combination with PTFE membranes as sample support, allow for smaller particle sizes ({$>$}0.1~μm) in water samples to be identified. The utilisation of these widely used membranes and the identification of several and specific (marker) ions for the three plastics in study (polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)), allows for the extraction of individual plastics from complex signals at trace levels. The method was validated against a number of standards, containing known quantities of MPs. Detection levels were then determined for PVC and PS and were found to be below {$<$}50 μg/L, with repeatable data showing good precision (\%RSD {$<$}20\%). Further verification of this new method was achieved by the analysis of a complex sample, sourced from a river. The results were positive for the presence of PS with a semi-quantifiable result of 241.8~μg/L. Therefore PY-GCToF seems to be a fit for purpose method for the identification of MPs and NPs from complex mixtures and matrices which have been deposited on PTFE membranes.},

Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is often added as a plasticizer by up to 40 wt\% to impart flexibility. DEHP, a toxin and carcinogen, can leach into the atmosphere to cause environmental contamination. This study investigates the suitability of epoxidized safflower oil, namely Carthamus tinctorius oil (ECTO), as a PVC plasticizer. PVC films with DEHP and ECTO were compared in resilience, elastic modulus, toughness, and glass transition temperature. ECTO films displayed statistically similar physical properties of resilience, elastic modulus, and toughness at up to 30 wt\%. ECTO films of 0 to 40 wt\% all displayed significantly lower glass transition temperature.},

MPs are considered a pollutant in soil on agricultural land, where they can act as a vector for other pollutants, namely organic chemical compounds, such as pesticides. In soil, presence of MPs is affecting the growth and life of microorganisms in it. The interactions between two types of MPs and three pesticides in the mixture with alluvial soil were studied. Adsorption of acetamiprid, chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide in concentrations of 1, 5 and 10~mg~L−1 onto polyester fibres and polypropylene particles of 0.5–1~mm size was studied at 1\% and 5\% (w/w) of their content in soil. Results showed that the adsorption of pesticides was dependent on their octanol/water partition coefficient, with the most highly adsorbed pesticide also being the most hydrophobic, regardless of the type and form of MPs. Adsorption of pesticides onto MP particles was confirmed in soil-MPs mixtures with 5\% polypropylene and 5\% polyester at all tested pesticides’ concentrations, proving that MPs in soil systems act as carriers to pollutants. MPs in soil decreased the soil’s intrinsic capacity to retain pesticides, indicating the possibility of a greater mobility of pesticides on MPs through the soil system.},

  abstract = {Small plastic particles are found ubiquitously in marine and freshwater ecosystems and consequently, their inhabitants. When aquatic animals are consumed as seafood, human exposure to those plastic particles is possible. However, only a few studies, applying largely different analytical procedures, assessed microplastics content in the edible part of seafood. In this study, ten protocols for the extraction of microplastics from biota were chosen and tested for their suitability to digest the edible part of a broad range of seafood species. The following criteria were used for this assessment: 1) feasibility to filtrate the entire digested sample with one filter of approximately 1~μm pore size, 2) effect of reagents applied during the sample preparation on the polymer integrity as assessed by means of infrared and Raman spectroscopy as well as pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry, 3) total sample preparation time and the possibility to avoid the use of expensive reagents. The most suitable protocol was found to be an enzymatic-alkaline approach, consisting of a quick hydrolysis of proteins with pepsin for 2~h and a consecutive alkaline hydrolysis for 4~h, both at 37~°C for most of the tested seafood species. Digestion efficiency of the optimised protocol was tested with fish fillets and soft tissues of commercially relevant molluscs and crustacean species. Compared to most other protocols described in literature, an adequate digestion of the seafood matrix was achieved faster without being significantly more cost- or labour-intensive. Moreover, only negligible degradation of eleven commercially relevant polymers excluding polyacrylonitrile was observed. Polymer integrity was assessed by a change in particle weight or surface as well as spectroscopic and chromatographic data. The optimised sample preparation protocol aims to support future method standardisation efforts in order to assess the dietary uptake of microplastics in humans.},

This has resulted in mounting worldwide concerns over the environmental consequences of such materials when they enter the mainstream after their intended uses. This led to the concept of designing and engineering new biodegradable materials–materials that have the performance characteristics of today's materials but that undergo biodegradation along with other organic waste to soil humic materials. Hence, the production of biodegradable materials from annually renewable agricultural feedstocks has attracted attention in recent years. Agricultural materials such as starches and proteins are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Soybean is a good candidate for manufacturing a large number of chemicals, including biodegradable plastics, as it is abundantly available and cheap. Soy protein concentrate, isolate, or flakes could be compounded with synthetic biodegradable plastics such as polycaprolactone or poly (lactic acid) to make molded products or edible films or shopping bags and make the environment cleaner and greener.},

  abstract = {Crop and rangelands are over 25\% of the Earth's land area, and they are expanding. Agricultural ecosystems rely on a suite of supporting ecosystem services to provide food, fiber and fuel as well as a range of accompanying but non-marketed ecosystem services (ES). Ecosystem services from agriculture include regulation of water and climate systems, aesthetic and cultural services, as well as enhanced supporting services (such as soil fertility). Many of these ES are appreciated by people, but they lack markets, so they lack the incentives for provision that come with prices. For public policy decisions to take them into account, non-market valuation techniques are needed, such as travel cost, contingent valuation, hedonic valuation, and cost-based or factor-income approaches. This article offers an overview of ES from agriculture and non-market valuation methods as it introduces the articles in this special section on “Ecosystem Services and Agriculture.” Understanding how ecological functions generate ES is fundamental to management, but so too is understanding how humans perceive and value those services. Research is required both to design cost-effective incentives to provide ES and to measure which kinds of ES could provide the greatest overall welfare benefits to society. Agricultural ecosystems offer newly recognized potential to deliver more diverse ecosystem services and mitigate the level of past ecosystem disservices. This special section of Ecological Economics conveys both how these are becoming possible and the challenges to science and public policy design of turning that potential into reality.},

  abstract = {Risk perception has a significant impact on how society reacts to a given risk. There have been cases where a mismatch between the actual risk and the perception of it has led to poor decisions on societal initiatives, such as inappropriate regulatory measures. It is therefore important that the perception of risk is based on an informed foundation acknowledging the biases and drivers that inevitably go with risk perception. Plastic pollution differs in regard to other classical risks, such as those posed by chemicals or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), since the pollution is more visible and already has a significant magnitude. At the same time, everyone is familiar with using plastic, and our daily lives are highly dependent on the use of plastic. This offers some potential to strengthen the societal risk perception and subsequently implement effective measures to address the pollution.In this chapter, we define eight risk perception drivers (voluntariness, control, knowledge, timing, severity, benefit, novelty, and tangibility) and relate these drivers to plastic pollution. We discuss the process in which plastic pollution has been recognized as an important environmental problem by scientists, the public, and policy makers and elaborate on how the eight risk drivers have influenced this process. Plastic pollution has several of the characteristics that can enhance people’s perception of the risk as being important and which has generated great awareness of the problem. The chapter finally discusses how risk perception can be improved by greater stakeholder involvement and utilization of citizen science and thereby improve the foundation for timely and efficient societal measures.},

The authors recently proposed in a viewpoint article that MP applied to land in this way may well contaminate other areas in an uncontrolled way. This study examined experimental plots with known history of application of sewage sludge. Results showed that 44\% of the MP load found on sludge-applied land was found on nearby land never directly applied with sludge. Examination of polymer type compositions demonstrated marked similarity between the two fields indicating the sludge-applied field was a source of contamination for surrounding areas. Furthermore, MP was detected at a depth of 60–90~cm in the sludge-applied soil indicating that MP may also penetrate deep enough to reach agricultural drainage systems, although this effect is slight (1.6\% of surface load). These results show that application of municipal sewage sludge on agricultural land can lead to further uncontrolled contamination, paving the way for future research to improve understanding of the extents of such effects on real farms to better inform future agricultural policy.},

  abstract = {Microplastics ({$<$}5 mm) have been documented in environmental samples on a global scale. While these pollutants may enter aquatic environments via wastewater treatment facilities, the abundance of microplastics in these matrices has not been investigated. Although efficient methods for the analysis of microplastics in sediment samples and marine organisms have been published, no methods have been developed for detecting these pollutants within organic-rich wastewater samples. In addition, there is no standardized method for analyzing microplastics isolated from environmental samples. In many cases, part of the identification protocol relies on visual selection before analysis, which is open to bias. In order to address this, a new method for the analysis of microplastics in wastewater was developed. A pretreatment step using 30\% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was employed to remove biogenic material, and focal plane array (FPA)-based reflectance micro-Fourier-transform (FT-IR) imaging was shown to successfully image and identify different microplastic types (polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon-6, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene). Microplastic-spiked wastewater samples were used to validate the methodology, resulting in a robust protocol which was nonselective and reproducible (the overall success identification rate was 98.33\%). The use of FPA-based micro-FT-IR spectroscopy also provides a considerable reduction in analysis time compared with previous methods, since samples that could take several days to be mapped using a single-element detector can now be imaged in less than 9 h (circular filter with a diameter of 47 mm). This method for identifying and quantifying microplastics in wastewater is likely to provide an essential tool for further research into the pathways by which microplastics enter the environment.},

Compared with the control, semi-solarization and full solarization (solarization) increased the mean soil temperature at 25 cm depth by 8.6–12.6 and 12.6–16.3 °C, respectively. Solarization reduced the total fungal population by 57.8–96.0\% at 25 cm and 97.0–99.7\% at 5 cm depth. The populations of native Fusarium spp. were reduced from 2–7×103 to 0–25 colony forming units (cfu) per gram of soil. Solarization reduced the population of Fom grown in sterile soil samples from 3.8–60×105 cfu g−1 to 0–60 cfu g−1 in samples buried at 5 cm depth and 0–90 cfu g−1 in those placed at 15 and 25 cm depth in four out of five trials. Semi-solarization had a significant detrimental effect on total fungi, Fusarium spp. and Fom populations in some experiments. Solarization reduced Fusarium wilt incidence by 82–90\% in three out of five trials. In one assay wilt was reduced by 43.5\%, and in another there was no reduction in disease, possibly because of rainy weather during the treatment. The reduction in disease incidence (\%) was proportional to the Ln of the time soil temperatures remained at or above 40 °C (R2=0.87) or at or above ⩾42 °C (R2=0.91) at 25 cm depth.

  abstract = {Conducting polymers have attracted great attention since their discovery at the end of the 70's due to their high conductivity, versatility and structural flexibility. Various methods have been developed for their structural characterization but few are useful for microstructure elucidation. This study demonstrates the ability of Pyroiysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry to examine both the thermal degradation behavior and microstructure of thiophene-based conducting polymers. -- Unsubstituted polythiophenes, i.e., polythiophene, poly(2,2'-bithiophene),  and poly(2,2':5',2"-terthiophene) were prepared by galvanostatical electropolymerization. β-substituted polythiophenes, i.e. poly (3-alkylthiophene)s (alkyl = methyl, hexyl, octyl), poly(3-methoxythiophene) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene), were synthesized either electrochemicaliy or chemically. Optimum pyrolysis temperatures for high yields of structurally-important fragments were established by investigating pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 1400°C. Comparison of polythiophenes shows that the yield of H₂S decreases, while the yield of thiophene oligomer fragments increases, as the chain length of the precursor oligomer increases. These results reflect decreasing the conjugation length from polythiophene to poiyterthiophene. The predominant polymeric  linkage in unsubstituted polythiophenes is α-α' along with non-negligible amounts of α-β' linkage. Evidence of partial overoxidation of polythiophene during electropolymerization was also obtained from the pyrograms. Structural analysis of oligomer fragments obtained from pyrolysis of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s gave useful stereoregularity information (i.e., head / tail configurations). Furthermore, based on the pyrolysis products, possible degradation pathways of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s were established.},

In contrast, many horticultural systems are de- signed to optimize yield per plant rather than per unit land area; they demand less dense plant spacings to achieve the desired quality and to facilitate cultivation, harvesting, and produce handling. Less dense plantings create “sparse” crops, where the canopy does not fully shade the underlying surface. Therefore, environmental interactions in most horticul- tural crops include those between the plant and the exposed soil as well as those between the plant and the atmosphere. The economic value of most horticultural crops routinely justifies modifying the crop’s microclimate to accelerate growth, improve quality, and/or extend the growing season. Environmental modifications can be expen- sive, as in the cases of heated glasshouses and supplemental lighting, or they can be techno- logically simple and inexpensive, as in the case of home gardeners’ “hot caps” or “wall- o-water.” To achieve the most economically efficient and biologically effective microcli- mate, one must understand the physics of energy transfer between the crop and the envi- ronment. Although these physical principles have not changed during the past 25 years (Tanner, 1974), we have improved some of the techniques of monitoring the crop microcli- mate and have measured energy exchanges in a variety of horticultural systems. This paper will review previous research and present new data to demonstrate the influence of black plastic mulch on the plant microclimate, with an analysis based on the physical principles outlined by Tanner (1974).},

The impact of this pollution on the ecosystem is not fully understood mainly due to the lack of analytical methods to detect and quantify micro(nano)plastic. The use of mass spectrometry was initially not considered as technique of choice but a steady flow of recent publications show its promises. This review is giving a thorough state of the art on the use of thermal degradation-mass spectroscopy for the detection of micro(nano)plastics and points at technological issues that remain to be resolved. It is discussed the possibility to perform minimum sample purification which is a substantial advantage compare to existing methods. Matrix interferences are discussed with regards to the indicator compounds selected. Mass spectrometry development, like the use of high resolution, opens up promising perspectives to improve the method performances. Mass spectrometry will be a major tool in this domain in the near future.},

In this work, plastic debris was collected in the North Atlantic sub-tropical gyre during the Expedition 7th Continent sea campaign and consisted mainly in PE. While the mechanisms of PE photodegradation and biodegradation in controlled laboratory conditions are well known, plastic weathering in the environment is not well understood. This is a difficult task to examine because debris comes from a variety of manufactured objects, the original compositions and properties of which vary considerably. A statistical approach was therefore used to compare four sample sets: reference PE, manufactured objects, mesoplastics (5–20~mm) and microplastics (0.3–5~mm). Infrared spectroscopy showed that the surface of all debris presented a higher oxidation state than the reference samples. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the microplastics were more crystalline contrarily to the mesoplastics which were similar to references samples. Size exclusion chromatography showed that the molar mass decreased from the references to meso- and microplastics, revealing a clear degradation of the polymer chains. It was thus concluded that the morphology of marine microplastic was much altered and that an unambiguous shortening of the polymer chains took place even for this supposedly robust and inert polymer.},

Some of these compounds are added during plastics manufacture, while others adsorb from the surrounding seawater. Concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants adsorbed on plastics showed distinct spatial variations reflecting global pollution patterns. Model calculations and experimental observations consistently show that polyethylene accumulates more organic contaminants than other plastics such as polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride. Both a mathematical model using equilibrium partitioning and experimental data have demonstrated the transfer of contaminants from plastic to organisms. A feeding experiment indicated that PCBs could transfer from contaminated plastics to streaked shearwater chicks. Plasticizers, other plastics additives and constitutional monomers also present potential threats in terrestrial environments because they can leach from waste disposal sites into groundwater and/or surface waters. Leaching and degradation of plasticizers and polymers are complex phenomena dependent on environmental conditions in the landfill and the chemical properties of each additive. Bisphenol A concentrations in leachates from municipal waste disposal sites in tropical Asia ranged from sub µg l–1 to mg l–1 and were correlated with the level of economic development.},

For both methods, there was no significant change in the carbon yield with the change in pyrolysis environment. However, the mixing-method produced higher aromatic hydrocarbons than the bed-method. In addition, two methods were also tested using two ratios of biomass to catalyst. Nonetheless, there was no significant increase in hydrocarbon yield as the catalyst loading was increased from two to five times of biomass in the catalyst-bed method. In contrast to this, a significant increase was noticed for the catalytic-mixing method when the biomass to catalyst loading was increased from 1:4 to 1:9.},

Upward diffusion of the two isomers in the Arredondo soil without a plastic cover was greatly influenced by soil-water content and (Z)-1,3-D diffused faster than (E)-1,3-D. In less than 5 h after 1,3-D injection to 30 cm depth, (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D in air dry soil had diffused to a 10 cm depth, whereas diffusion for the two isomers was negligible in near-water-saturated soil, even 101 h after injection. The diffusion rate of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D in near-field-capacity soil was between the rates in the two water regimes. Yard waste compost (YWC) amendment greatly reduced diffusion of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D, even in air-dry soil. Although upward diffusion of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D in soil with VIF cover was slightly less than in the corresponding bare soil; the cover promoted retention of vapors of the two isomers in soil pore air in the shallow subsurface. More (Z)-1,3-D vapor was found initially in soil pore air than (E)-1,3-D although the difference declined thereafter. As a result of rapid upward movement in air-dry bare soil, (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D were rapidly volatilized into the atmosphere, but emissions from the near-water-saturated soil were minimal. Virtually impermeable film and YWC amendment retarded emissions. This study indicated that adequate soil water in this sandy soil is needed to prevent rapid emissions, but excess soil water slows diffusion of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D. Thus, management for optimum water in soil is critical for pesticidal efficacy and the environment. Copyright © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Although most plastic pollution originates on land, current research largely remains focused on aquatic ecosystems. Studies pioneering terrestrial microplastic research have adapted analytical methods from aquatic research without acknowledging the complex nature of soil. Meanwhile, novel methods have been developed and further refined. However, methodical inconsistencies still challenge a comprehensive understanding of microplastic occurrence and fate in and on soil. This review aims to disentangle the variety of state-of-the-art sample preparation techniques for heterogeneous solid matrices to identify and discuss best-practice methods for soil-focused microplastic analyses. We show that soil sampling, homogenization, and aggregate dispersion are often neglected or incompletely documented. Microplastic preconcentration is typically performed by separating inorganic soil constituents with high-density salt solutions. Not yet standardized but currently most used separation setups involve overflowing beakers to retrieve supernatant plastics, although closed-design separation funnels probably reduce the risk of contamination. Fenton reagent may be particularly useful to digest soil organic matter if suspected to interfere with subsequent microplastic quantification. A promising new approach is extraction of target polymers with organic solvents. However, insufficiently characterized soils still impede an informed decision on optimal sample preparation. Further research and method development thus requires thorough validation and quality control with well-characterized matrices to enable robust routine analyses for terrestrial microplastics.},

  abstract = {Plastics have transformed everyday life; usage is increasing and annual production is likely to exceed 300 million tonnes by 2010. In this concluding paper to the Theme Issue on Plastics, the Environment and Human Health, we synthesize current understanding of the benefits and concerns surrounding the use of plastics and look to future priorities, challenges and opportunities. It is evident that plastics bring many societal benefits and offer future technological and medical advances. However, concerns about usage and disposal are diverse and include accumulation of waste in landfills and in natural habitats, physical problems for wildlife resulting from ingestion or entanglement in plastic, the leaching of chemicals from plastic products and the potential for plastics to transfer chemicals to wildlife and humans. However, perhaps the most important overriding concern, which is implicit throughout this volume, is that our current usage is not sustainable. Around 4 per cent of world oil production is used as a feedstock to make plastics and a similar amount is used as energy in the process. Yet over a third of current production is used to make items of packaging, which are then rapidly discarded. Given our declining reserves of fossil fuels, and finite capacity for disposal of waste to landfill, this linear use of hydrocarbons, via packaging and other short-lived applications of plastic, is simply not sustainable. There are solutions, including material reduction, design for end-of-life recyclability, increased recycling capacity, development of bio-based feedstocks, strategies to reduce littering, the application of green chemistry life-cycle analyses and revised risk assessment approaches. Such measures will be most effective through the combined actions of the public, industry, scientists and policymakers. There is some urgency, as the quantity of plastics produced in the first 10 years of the current century is likely to approach the quantity produced in the entire century that preceded.},

We conducted a study to characterize dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil microbial community by comparing greenhouse vegetable fields with contrasting management intensity and adjacent cereal fields (wheat–maize rotation) in Shouguang and Quzhou in North China. Compared with cereal fields, greenhouse vegetable cultivation increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), while it decreased the soil pH, particularly at the high-intensity site. The DOC concentration was significantly higher in greenhouse vegetable fields than in cereal fields, whereas DOC composition differed between greenhouse vegetable fields and cereal fields only at high management intensity. Chemical fractionation indicated that DOC from greenhouse vegetable fields with high management intensity was less decomposed than DOC from cereal fields, because the percentage of hydrophobic acid (HOA) as DOC was higher in vegetable fields. Vegetable production significantly changed the microbial community structure in comparison to cereal fields: high-intensity management increased total bacteria, G (+) bacteria and fungi, while low-intensity decreased fungi and increased bacteria-to-fungi ratio. The main factor affecting microbial community structure was soil pH in this study, accounting for 24\% of the differences.},

Based on a long-term field experiment (10 years), we analyzed the impact of non-flooded mulching cultivation and cropping season on labile SOM fractions in a rice–wheat rotation in Chengdu Plain, southwest China. Compared with traditional flooding (TF), the plastic film mulching (PM) and wheat straw mulching (SM) treatments increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (42\% after rice season and 41\% after wheat season), but decreased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) (19\% after rice season and 28\% after wheat season) and nitrogen (MBN) (17\% after rice season and 24\% after wheat season) in the 0–5~cm depth. SM increased particulate organic carbon (POC) and KMnO4-oxidizable C (KMnO4-C) contents after both the rice and wheat seasons. Microbial biomass and DOC concentrations were higher for all three cultivations after the rice season than after the wheat season. In contrast, POC contents under PM and SM were higher after the wheat season than after the rice season. In general, results in this study indicate that non-flooded mulching and cropping season significantly influenced labile SOM fractions. The DOC fraction was the most sensitive fraction affected by non-flooded mulching, while POC and PON fractions respond fast within the two cropping seasons.},

In 1986, an experiment was initiated on a Cecil sandy loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludult) at Griffin, GA. Tomato yield and root growth, soil temperature, and water potential in 1987 and 1988 were compared using black plastic mesh and straw mulches and three micro-irrigation frequencies: control (no irrigation), daily, and twice weekly. Soil properties beneath the two types of mulches were compared in terms of surface evaporation, measured during 24-h periods several times each year and bulk density, organic C, pH, infiltration rate, and cone index measured at the end of the 1988 growing season. Straw mulch resulted in a significantly greater infiltration rate, and lower pH, bulk density, surface evaporation, cone index, soil temperature and matric potential than the plastic mulch. Yields were higher under the straw mulch compared to the plastic mulch and irrigation increased yield with a straw mulch in 1987 but not 1988. Yields were not increased by irrigation of the plastic mulch treatment. Straw mulches have the potential to improve tomato yields in high-temperature environments, provided soil pH is controlled.},

Microbial respiration rate was highest in soils mulched with composted yard wastes (17.2 and 15.3 mg CO2 kg−1 per day for non-fertilized and fertilized plots, respectively) and lowest in bare soil plots (5.0 and 9.4 mg CO2 kg−1 per day for non-fertilized and fertilized plots, respectively). In general, the other parameters were highest in plots mulched with composted yard waste and not affected by fertilization. Bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. Straight Light) seedlings grown in the microcosms were analyzed using most probable number (MPN) analysis of culturable heterotrophic fluorescent pseudomonads in King’s B medium as well as by analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLPs) of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes. Populations of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere were significantly greater in the composted yard waste plots than the bare soil fertilized mulched plots. TRFLP analysis of PCR amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes from triplicate root tips grown in each treatment and digested with HhaI, MspI, and RsaI revealed that the TRFLP similarity was 0.81–0.91 among triplicate samples and 0.48–0.86 among different treatments. The TRFLP pattern of rhizosphere communities from the bare soil treatment were more similar (54–82\%) to plots mulched with ground wood than to plots mulched with compost. Only 48–71\% of TRFLP peaks detected in samples from the compost treatment were also detected in the bare soil control. The similarity in TRFLPs between the compost and ground wood pallet treatments was 56–80\%. Although the community profiles showed differences in bacterial diversity, no significant difference in TRFLP-based diversity indices were observed. Unique TRF peaks detected among treatments suggest that specific subcomponents of the microbial communities differed. A higher number of TRFs corresponding with biocontrol organisms such as Pseudomonas and Pantoea spp. were observed in plots mulched with compost. However, the mulch treatments had more pronounced effects on soil chemical and microbial properties than on TRFLP based bacterial community structure on cucumber roots. Nonetheless, the data show clearly that mulching with compost strongly influenced the structure of the microbial rhizophere community.},

  abstract = {The experiments were conducted on the lateritic sandy loam soils of Kharagpur, West Bengal, India during middle of September–January for 3 years (1997–2000) to evaluate the economic feasibility of growing cabbage crop under drip irrigation with mulches. Actual evapotranspiration for cabbage crop was estimated by using the modified Penman method and net daily irrigation requirement was estimated after subtracting effective rainfall. Estimated irrigation requirement was supplied by a 4 l h−1 emitter for four plants with the drip irrigation system being operated from 70 to 101 min per day during the crop season. The average seasonal water requirement of crop was estimated to be 400 mm. The yields of the cabbage under 25 μm thick black plastic mulch (PM) were studied using three levels of drip irrigation which applied 100\% (VD), 80\% (0.8VD) and 60\% (0.6VD) of the estimated irrigation requirement. The yield response under two organic mulches, rice husk with drip (VDH) and paddy straw with drip (VDS) were also studied. For comparison, furrow irrigated (VF) treatments were used and the study revealed 62.44\% higher yield in case of drip (VD) as compared to furrow irrigation. Even higher yields were obtained for drip irrigation with PM (VD+PM), 111.72 t ha−1 as compared to 106.68 t ha−1 for (VD). The treatments VDH and VDS showed, respectively, 2.05 and 1.18\% higher yield when compared with drip (VD) alone. The net seasonal income was estimated to be highest as US\$ 4333 in case of treatment VD+PM. The highest benefit–cost ratio of 8.17 was obtained for furrow irrigation (VF) followed by 6.99 for drip (VD). The net profit per mm of water used was obtained to be highest (US\$ 16.51) in case of drip irrigation (0.6VD) followed by US\$ 16.32 under the treatment 0.6VD+PM. The highest yield per unit quantity of water used was 427.04 kg ha−1 mm−1 for the treatment 0.6VD+PM. The study reveals that drip irrigation has a definite role in increasing the productivity of cabbage.},

Effect of two organic mulches (rice husk and rice straw) were also studied with drip irrigation. The results of furrow irrigation either alone or in conjunction with black plastic mulch conditions were compared with drip irrigation in terms of growth and yield of the crop. The study indicated that 100\% irrigation requirement met through drip irrigation along with black plastic mulch (VD+PM) gave the highest yield (14.51 t ha−1 ) with 72\% increase in yield as compared to furrow irrigation.

Beads (oval shape, \textasciitilde 5 mm) and fragments (irregular shaped, 250–50 μm and 500–1000 μm) were subjected to relatively harsh simulated accelerated weathering conditions (using a filtered xenon-arc reproducing sunlight's full spectrum) for up to 37 and 80 days, respectively. Samples collected (n = 10 replicates for each treatment) at increasing number of weathering days were analysed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry in order to assess the extent and the rate of degradation. The rate of surface oxidation occurred faster for fragments compared to beads, probably due to their higher surface area. Quantification of the polypropylene trimer (2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene) via double shot Pyr-GC/MS, showed that the signal of the trimer relative to the mass of polypropylene was reduced through weathering with a degradation rate of 1:3 faster for fragments over beads. Signal reduction and carbonyl index were correlated to show that polypropylene with a carbonyl index of ≥13 has a significantly reduced 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene signal when compared to virgin material. Consequently, the quantification of polypropylene subjected to weathering under harsh conditions may be underestimated by 42\% (fragments, carbonyl index: 18) to 49\% (beads, carbonyl index: 30) when quantified by Pyr-GC/MS and using virgin polypropylene calibration standards. Pyrolysis at a lower temperature (350 °C) identified six degradation specific markers (oxidation products) that increased in concentration with weathering. Further comparisons between virgin and weathered microplastics may need to be considered to avoid underestimation of microplastic concentrations in future studies.},

Films were stabilized with 1000~ppm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), no UV stabilizer was used. Accelerated ageing was realized in a Q-Sun Xe-1 exposure chamber using a filtered xenon light source and a dry cycle. Weathering was carried out at Brno exposure site, representing the typical mid-European climate. Accelerated ageing was carried out at temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70~°C. In accelerated ageing, both the onset of carbonyl index (CI) increase and the point of reaching the same relative increase in CI as due to weathering were used as measures of polymer degradation. For induction periods attained at different temperatures, TUVR energies were calculated accordingly and compared to that of 6 months outdoor exposure. It was found that if TUVR of both types of ageing is to be directly compared, accelerated ageing should be carried out at temperatures of 32–36~°C. Under such conditions, the same amount of TUVR energy induces the same extent of polymer deterioration in both types of ageing and may, therefore, be used for a reliable service life-time prediction.},

Antarctic climate is typical with a higher portion of solar ultraviolet (UV) part in the global radiation and extremely low temperatures. Overall effect of Antarctic climatic conditions on polymer environmental degradation was investigated. Weathering experiments were carried out on 0.5 mm isotactic polypropylene homopolymer (h-PP) extruded films - non-UV-stabilized and stabilized with 1000 ppm HALS-1 (low-molecular) and 1000 ppm HALS-2 (oligomeric), respectively. The materials were exposed on James Ross Island in Antarctica for 3 years. A parallel reference series representing weathering in Central Europe (CE) was exposed in Brno, Czech Republic. Climatic data such as incident UV-A, UV-B and global radiation, outdoor air temperatures and total ozone content (TOC) were recorded during the experiment at both exposure sites. Degradation changes in polymer matrix were determined using GPC, FTIR, DSC, TGA, LTHS, SEM techniques and tensile tests. The measurements provided valuable data on h-PP photo-oxidation in Antarctica, on its possible UV stabilization and showed that despite extremes in environmental conditions h-PP degradation rate in Antarctica was still slower compared to CE. Beside UV radiation, higher ambient temperatures accelerating the secondary propagation reactions of alkylperoxy radicals are mainly responsible for the faster photo-degradation in CE.},

  abstract = {Sustainable soil management requires reliable and accurate monitoring of changes in soil organic matter (SOM). However, despite the development of improved analytical techniques during the last decades, there are still limits in the detection of small changes in soil organic carbon content and SOM composition. This study focused on the detection of such changes under laboratory conditions by adding different organic amendments to soils. The model experiments consisted of artificially mixing soil samples from non-fertilized plots of three German long-term agricultural experiments in Bad Lauchstädt (silty loam), Grossbeeren (silty sand), and Müncheberg (loamy sand) with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal in quantities from 3 to 180 t ha−1 each. In these mixtures we determined the organic carbon contents by elemental analysis and by thermal mass losses (TML) determined by thermogravimetry. The results confirmed the higher reliability of elemental analysis compared to TML for organic carbon content determination. The sensitivity of both methods was not sufficient to detect the changes in organic carbon content caused by small quantities of organic amendments (3 t ha−1 or 0.1–0.4 g C kg−1 soil). In the case of elemental analysis, the detectability of changes in carbon content increased with quantities of added amendments, but the method could not distinguish different types of organic amendments. On the contrary, the based on analysis of degradation temperatures, the TML allowed this discrimination together with their quantitative analysis. For example, added charcoal was not visible in TML from 320 to 330°C, which is used for carbon content determination. However, increasing quantities of charcoal were reflected in a higher TML around 520°C. Furthermore, differences between measured (with TML110–550) and predicted mass loss on ignition using both organic carbon (with TML330) and clay contents (with TML140) were confirmed as a suitable indicator for detection of organic amendments in different types of soils. We conclude that thermogravimetry enables the sensitive detection of organic fertilizers and organic amendments in soils under arable land use.},

Results were reported in terms of carbon yields of organic fractions (Py-GC–AED) and individual pyrolysis products (Py-GC–MS). Global carbon yields of gas and semi/volatile compounds were determined from the chromatograms of Py-GC–AED. The relatively non-volatile fraction eluding GC elution and the solid residue left after pyrolysis (char) were determined by weighting the quartz tube after each Py-GC–AED experiment. The semi-volatile fraction and non-volatile matter were assumed to compose the final bio-oil. The yield of semi-volatile ranged from 26\% (poplar) to 19\% (corn stover), while gas yields were similar for all biomass types (10–11\% on carbon basis). Py-GC–MS was conducted in the presence of an internal standard (o-isoeugenol) in order to quantify principal lignin phenols along with hemi/cellulose degradation products. Acetic acid and hydroxyacetone were the main pyrolysis products with similar yields for all tested biomass. Herbaceous biomass provided 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol as most intense lignin monomers, while sorghum pyrolysate was featured by high yields of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde. In comparison to herbaceous biomass, poplar was predicted to produce high yield of organic bio-oil rich in lignin monomers and with a lower content of non-volatile matter. Among herbaceous biomass, switchgrass was characterised by the lowest ash and nitrogen content and a highest production of bio-oil.},

Due to their high persistence, MPs will accumulate in the environment and their quantities tend to increase with time. MPs end up in environments where often also chemical contaminants are present. Since the early 2000s, the number of studies on the sorption of chemicals to plastic particles has exponentially increased. The objective of this study was to critically review the literature to identify the most important factors affecting the sorption of chemical contaminants to MPs. These factors include the physicochemical properties of both the MPs and the chemical contaminants as well as environmental characteristics. A limited number of studies on soil together with an increased notion of the importance of this compartment as a final sink for MPs was observed. Therefore, we assessed the distribution of model chemicals (two PCBs and phenanthrene) in the soil compartment in the presence of MPs using a mass balance model. The results showed a high variation among chemicals and microplastic types. Overall, a higher partitioning to MPs of chemical contaminants in soil is expected in comparison to aquatic environments. As sorption to a large extent determines bioavailability, the effects of combined exposure to chemicals and MPs on the toxicity and bioaccumulation in biota are discussed. Finally, some considerations regarding sorption and toxicity studies using MPs are given.},

  abstract = {Predictions from climate simulation models suggest that by 2050 mean temperatures on the Loess Plateau of China will increase by 2.5 to 3.75°C, while those in the cropping region of south-west Australia will increase by 1.25 to 1.75°C. By 2050, rainfall is not expected to change on the Loess Plateau of China, while in south-west Australia rainfall is predicted to decrease by 20 to 60~mm. The frequency of heat waves and dry spells is predicted to increase in both regions. The implications of rising temperatures are an acceleration of crop phenology and a reduction in crop yields, greater risk of reproductive failure from extreme temperatures, and greater risk of crop failure. The reduction in yield from increased phenological development can be countered by selecting longer-season cultivars and taking advantage of warmer minimum temperatures and reduced frost risk to plant earlier than with current temperatures. Breeding for tolerance of extreme temperatures will be necessary to counter the increased frequency of extreme temperatures, while a greater emphasis on breeding for increased drought resistance and precipitation-use efficiency will lessen the impact of reduced rainfall. Management options likely to be adopted in south-west Australia include the introduction of drought-tolerant perennial fodder species and shifting cropping to higher-rainfall areas. On the Loess Plateau of China, food security is paramount so that an increased area of heat-tolerant and high-yielding maize, mulching with residues and plastic film, better weed and pest control and strategic use of supplemental irrigation to improve rainfall-use efficiency are likely to be adopted.},

  abstract = {Primary microplastics have been collected from 17 beaches along the Atlantic, English Channel and southern North Sea coasts of western Europe. Based on visual characteristics, these plastics were differentiated as either relatively smooth, lentil- or disc-shaped pre-production pellets (or nurdles), which were usually a few mm in diameter and were mainly white to off-white, or rougher and more irregular pellets that were slightly larger and usually black. The latter appeared to be bio-beads, or plastics that are specifically manufactured for use as biomedia in certain sewage water treatment (SWT) plants and, possibly, in other industrial wastewater treatment applications. Identification of bio-beads was confirmed following the acquisition of identical samples from a SWT plant in southwest England and a French supplier of bio-beads. Infrared and x-ray fluorescence analysis revealed that bio-beads have, at least historically, been constructed of plasticised polyethylene and, unlike pre-production pellets, contained variable quantities of potentially toxic elements: Br, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb and Sb; with a distinctive Br to Sb ratio indicative of brominated flame retardants and antimony-based retardant synergists. It is asserted that bio-beads have been manufactured from a heterogeneous mix of recycled polyethylene and end-of-life electrical and electronic plastic, with concentrations of Br, Cd, Cr or Pb in about 50 bio-beads (out of 497 analysed) non-compliant or potentially non-compliant with respect to current regulations on hazardous plastic waste. Concentrations of Br, Cd, Cr, Pb and Sb extracted from individual bio-beads by a simulated avian digestive fluid were variable, with maximum values of about 14, 0.8, 1.3, 20 and 1.4 μg g−1, respectively. The presence and, in many cases, dominance of bio-beads among beached primary microplastics is discussed with regard to the classification of microplastics and potential impacts on wildlife.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are widespread in natural ecosystems and have attracted considerable attention from scientists all over the world because they are believed to threaten every life form. In addition to their potential physical and chemical effects on organisms, MPs may act as a carrier for transferring many micropollutants including antibiotics, heavy metals and others. Over the last 10–15 years, extensive research has been carried out on MPs in marine environment, its sources, fate and toxicity. However, studies concerning their accumulation in soil ecosystem, uptake, internalization and impacts on photosynthetic components of the terrestrial ecosystem, and risk assessment have been scanty. Thus, there is a large knowledge gap on the extent to which terrestrial environments, especially agroecosystems are affected by MPs, and their subsequent risks to human health. This review summarizes up-to-date findings about MPs on terrestrial environments and would provide some guidelines for future studies regarding the phytotoxic effects of MPs on plants, mechanism of uptake and translocation in plant tissues, detection tools for MPs in plants, impacts on plant growth, development and agricultural productivity, and most importantly the future prospects of MPs interaction and accumulation in plants.

The survey is set within a conceptual perspective suggesting that affective responses such as aesthetic preference are central to a landscape observer's thoughts, conscious experience and behavior. Substantial progress has been made in developing models that relate aesthetic responses to specific visual properties of environments. When aesthetic preferences are compared for urban and unspectacular natural views, American and European adult groups evidence a strong tendency to prefer nature. However, liking for urban scenes usually increases when trees and other vegetation are present. Views of nature, compared to most urban scenes lacking natural elements such as trees, appear to have more positive influences on emotional and physiological states. The benefits of visual encounters with vegetation may be greatest for individuals experiencing stress or anxiety. Recent research demonstrates that responses to trees and other vegetation can be linked directly to health, and in turn related to economic benefits of visual quality.},

A quantitative pyr-GC/MS method based on characteristic tire polymer pyrolysis products was developed for tread particle quantification in environmental matrices including soil, sediment, and air. The feasibility of quantitative pyr-GC/MS analysis of tread was confirmed in a method evaluation study using artificial soil spiked with known amounts of cryogenically generated tread. Tread concentration determined by blinded analyses was highly correlated (r2 ³ 0.88) with the known tread spike concentration. Two critical refinements to the initial pyrolysis protocol were identified including use of an internal standard and quantification by the dimeric markers vinylcyclohexene and dipentene, which have good specificity for rubber polymer with no other appreciable environmental sources. A novel use of deuterated internal standards of similar polymeric structure was developed to correct the variable analyte recovery caused by sample size, matrix effects, and ion source variability. The resultant quantitative pyr-GC/MS protocol is reliable and transferable between laboratories.},

Hence, changes in the marine ecosystem caused by anthropogenic influences such as plastic pollution can have a dramatic impact on a global scale. Although the problem of plastics still remains unsolved, different ways are being considered to reduce their impact on the environment. One of them is to use microorganisms capable of degradation of plastic. A particularly interesting area is the application of microorganisms isolated from cold regions in view of their unique characteristics. Nevertheless, the interactions between plastic and microorganisms are still poorly known. Here, we present a review of current knowledge on plastic degradation and plastic-microorganism interactions in cold marine habitats. Moreover, we highlight the advantages of microorganisms isolated from this environment for eliminating plastic waste from ecosystems.},

Others have focused on the existence of non-monotonic dose–response curves. These concepts challenge the way that chemical risk assessment is performed for EDCs. Continued discussions have clarified exactly what controversies and challenges remain. We address several of these issues, including why the study and regulation of EDCs should incorporate endocrine principles; what level of consensus there is for low dose effects; challenges to our understanding of non-monotonicity; and whether EDCs have been demonstrated to produce adverse effects. This discussion should result in a better understanding of these issues, and allow for additional dialog on their impact on risk assessment.},

In recent years, research about microplastic pollution in the environment has become a field of study with increased interest, with ever expanding findings on sources, sinks and pathways of microplastics. Wastewater treatment plants effectively remove microplastics from wastewater and concentrate them in sewage sludge which is often used to fertilise agricultural fields. Despite this, quantification of microplastic pollution in agricultural fields through the application of sewage sludge is largely unknown. In light of this issue, four wastewater treatment plants and 16 agricultural fields (0–8 sewage sludge applications of 20–22 tons ha−1 per application), located in the east of Spain, were sampled. Microplastics were extracted using a floatation and filtration method, making a distinction between light density microplastics (ρ~{$<~$}1~g~cm−3) and heavy density microplastics (ρ~{$>~$}1~g~cm−3). Sewage sludge, on average, had a light density plastic load of 18,000~±~15,940 microplastics kg−1 and a heavy density plastic load of 32,070~±~19,080 microplastics kg−1. Soils without addition of sewage sludge had an average light density plastic load of 930~±~740 microplastics kg−1 and a heavy density plastic load of 1100~±~570 microplastics kg−1. Soils with addition of sewage sludge had an average light density plastic load of 2130~±~950 microplastics kg−1 and a heavy density plastic load of 3060~±~1680 microplastics kg−1. On average, soils’ plastic loads increased by 280 light density microplastics kg−1 and 430 heavy density microplastics kg−1 with each successive application of sewage sludge, indicating that sewage sludge application results in accumulation of microplastics in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {The Guadalentin Basin in Spain is one of the driest areas of Europe and has problems with high evaporation rates, and high risks of desertification exist including soil quality loss and soil erosion. Farmers in this semiarid region use polyethylene covers on their irrigated croplands to reduce evaporation to enhance crop yield. When farmers abandon the acres, they leave the plastic covers on the fields. Up to now research has been concentrating on the effects of plastic covers on crop yield and microclimate under these covers but there is little known about the effects of plastic covers and irrigation on soil quality, erosion susceptibility, and hydrology after abandonment of these fields. The research question in this paper is: How do the former irrigation practices and plastic soil covers affect organic C content, aggregate stability, hydrological properties, and erosion susceptibility? Organic C content and aggregate stability are important soil quality parameters that are easy to measure. Beside these two parameters, soil crusting, infiltration rates, and sediment yields have been determined for a set of irrigated fields that have been abandoned at different times (up to 20 yr) and where plastic covers have been used. The properties of these fields were compared with control sites with comparable periods of abandonment and substrate, but where only classical rain fed cropping systems have been applied. It was expected that leaving plastic remains in the soil after abandonment would be harmful to soil quality and would lower infiltration. The first associations with seeing the plastic are those of garbage and pollution. In fact, most of the indicators of soil quality considered in this survey turned out to be better or the same on the fields where irrigation and plastic covers had been used, when compared with control fields. Organic C contents were up to 40\% higher on fields where plastic sheets remain and soil aggregates were more stabile. Fields where plastic had been mixed with the soil by tillage showed lower erosion susceptibilities.},

Despite this recognition, the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier 1 method has a SOC change factor of 1 (no SOC loss) for conversion of forests to perennial tree crops, because of scarcity of SOC data. In this pantropic study, conducted in active deforestation regions of Indonesia, Cameroon, and Peru, we quantified the impact of forest conversion to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), and cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry plantations on SOC stocks within 3-m depth in deeply weathered mineral soils. We also investigated the underlying biophysical controls regulating SOC stock changes. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we compared SOC stocks from paired forests (n = 32) and adjacent plantations (n = 54). Our study showed that deforestation for tree plantations decreased SOC stocks by up to 50\%. The key variable that predicted SOC changes across plantations was the amount of SOC present in the forest before conversion—the higher the initial SOC, the higher the loss. Decreases in SOC stocks were most pronounced in the topsoil, although older plantations showed considerable SOC losses below 1-m depth. Our results suggest that (i) the IPCC tier 1 method should be revised from its current SOC change factor of 1 to 0.6 ± 0.1 for oil palm and cacao agroforestry plantations and 0.8 ± 0.3 for rubber plantations in the humid tropics; and (ii) land use management policies should protect natural forests on carbon-rich mineral soils to minimize SOC losses.},

The ERLs are derived using data on (eco)toxicology and environmental chemistry. Endpoints used are survival, growth, and reproduction. The resulting ERLs in water are 10 and 0.19 μg/L for DBP and DEHP, respectively; in fresh soil and sediment with 10\% organic matter the derived ERLs are respectively 0.7 and 1 mg/kg fresh wt. In The Netherlands, measured concentrations of DBP are seldom above the ERLs, while reported concentrations for DEHP are 3 to 20 times higher than the ERL. As phthalates as a group are commonly mentioned as chemicals with possible endocrine disruptive effects, in vivo and in vitro tests for a series of phthalates with endpoints related to endocrine disruption are reviewed. In vitro and in vivo tests give a similar distinction between phthalates that can or cannot act as endocrine disrupters. The significance of these tests for the derivation of ERLs is discussed. It is concluded that the ERLs derived will give sufficient protection against endocrine disruptive effects. There is no need to include additional data for DBP and DEHP, related to endpoints other than survival, growth, or reproduction, in the derivation of ERLs.},

The aim of this paper is to analyse the range of landscapes used in environmental psychology studies, and the evidence of health effects related to viewing these landscapes. A literature review of publications linking landscapes and health effects was conducted. This reported evidence of health and well-being effects related to exposure to visual landscapes. The results of the review include an overview of the types of landscape used in the studies, the evidence on health effects, the methods and measures applied and the different groups of respondents. The analysis reveals a predominance of studies using only coarse categories of landscapes. Most landscape representations have been classed as “natural” or “urban”. Few studies were found to use subcategories within these groups. Generally, the natural landscapes gave a stronger positive health effect compared to urban landscapes. Urban landscapes were found to have a less positive and in some cases negative effect on health. Three main kinds of health effects have been identified in the study; short-term recovery from stress or mental fatigue, faster physical recovery from illness and long-term overall improvement on people's health and well-being. The study provides an overview of the relationships between health and landscapes arranged in an accessible format, identifying gaps in our knowledge requiring further research. The identification of quantifiable landscape attributes that affect health is seen as an important factor in enabling future landscape design to be of benefit to human health.},

Effects of salinity and sediment organic matter fouling were assessed by measuring the isotherms in fresh- and seawater, with and without sediment present. Sorption to the “bulk” sorbents sediment organic matter (OM) and micro-PE occurred through linear hydrophobic partitioning with OM and micro-PE having similar sorption affinity. Sorption to MWCNT and nano-PS was nonlinear. PCB sorption to MWCNT and C60 was 3–4 orders of magnitude stronger than to OM and micro-PE. Sorption to nano-PS was 1–2 orders of magnitude stronger than to micro-PE, which was attributed to the higher aromaticity and surface–volume ratio of nano-PS. Organic matter effects varied among sorbents, with the largest OM fouling effect observed for the high surface sorbents MWCNT and nano-PS. Salinity decreased sorption for sediment and MWCNT but increased sorption for the polymers nano-PS and micro-PE. The exceptionally strong sorption of (planar) PCBs to C60, MWCNT, and nano-PS may imply increased hazards upon membrane transfer of these particles.},

Methodological advances in microplastic extraction, quantification and identification from sediments have been made. However, integrating these fragmentary advances into a holistic, cost-effective protocol and applying it to organic rich sediments with fine grain size remains a challenge. Nonetheless, many hot spots of microplastic contamination such as harbour and estuarine sediments are characterised by such sediments. We conducted a series of experiments to integrate methodological advances, and clarify their applicability to organic rich sediments with fine grain size. The resulting protocol consisted of three stages. First, pre-treatment with Fenton’s reagent was found to be efficient in reducing organic matter content, compatible with later Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) for polymer identification, although it did affect the size of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Secondly, a novel density separation column with a top overflow (the OC-T) obtained recovery rates above 90\% for microplastics present in a ZnCL2 solution. Finally, automated epifluorescence microscopic image analysis of Nile Red stained filters with selected validation of polymer identities using FT-IR revealed 91.7\% of stained particles to be plastics. A case study on estuarine sediments demonstrated a high extraction efficiency with quantification possible down to 125~μm and detection possible down to 62.5~μm. This makes this protocol suitable for large scale monitoring of microplastics in sediments of estuarine origin provided polymer specific recovery rates, background contamination and uncertainty in Nile Red identification is accounted for. Subject to further validation, the protocol could also offer a solution to similar organic rich sediments with fine grain size, such as some soils and sludge, to improve our ability to conduct cost-effective, large scale monitoring of microplastic contamination.},

Indeed, through a careful assessment of the TS currently in use, this study evidenced that these guidelines cover only a fraction of the biogeochemical parameters seen in nature and largely disregard those that occur in the deep-sea. Thus, these TS may not be able to ensure the degradation of such polymers in natural environments, where microbial activity, pH, temperature, salinity, UV radiation and pressure are highly variable. This raises environmental concern, since relevant parcel of plastic ends up in the oceans reaching deep zones. Therefore, there is an urgent need to revise these TS, which must consider the actual fate of most plastic debris and include assessments under the challenging conditions found at these types of environment, alongside microplastic formation and ecotoxicology effects. Moreover, the next generation of biodegradability tests must be designed to enable a cost-effective implementation and incorporate accurate analytical techniques to assess polymer transformation. Furthermore, certification should provide information on time scale and degradation rates and, preferably, be globally harmonized.},

  abstract = {Soil functions, including climate regulation and the cycling of water and nutrients, are of central importance for a number of environmental issues of great societal concern. To understand and manage these functions, it is crucial to be able to quantify the structure of soils, now increasingly referred to as their “architecture”, as it constraints the physical, chemical, and biological processes in soils. This quantification was traditionally approached from two different angles, one focussed on aggregates of the solid phase, and the other on the pore space. The recent development of sophisticated, non-disturbing imaging techniques has led to significant progress in the description of soil architecture, in terms of both the pore space and the spatial configuration of mineral and organic materials. We now have direct access to virtually all aspects of soil architecture. In the present article, we review how this affects the perception of soil architecture specifically when trying to describe the functions of soils. A key conclusion of our analysis is that soil architecture, in that context, imperatively needs to be explored in its natural state, with as little disturbance as possible. The same requirement applies to the key processes taking place in the hierarchical soil pore network, including those contributing to the emergence of a heterogeneous organo-mineral soil matrix by various mixing processes such as bioturbation, diffusion, microbial metabolism and organo-mineral interactions. Artificially isolated aggregates are fundamentally inappropriate to derive conclusions about the functioning of an intact soil. To fully account for soil functions, we argue that a holistic approach that centres on the pore space is mandatory while the dismantlement of soils into chunks may still be carried out to study the binding of soil solid components. In the future, significant progress is expected along this holistic direction, as new, advanced technologies become available. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

It is shown that in the former case, the processes occur throughout the entire body of the polymer and, in the latter case, the aging processes is concentrated in microscopic zones (shear bands) that emerge during polymer deformation.

We describe SOM quality for three management practices, Organic Farming system (OF), Integrated Crop Production (ICP) and pasture sites (G), which intend to achieve sustainable management practice. The experimental sites were conventionally farmed until 1992. SOM quality was examined by describing active SOM pools, such as the decomposed ‘young soil organic matter’ (YSOM), ratio of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) to organic carbon (Corg), ecophysiological status of the microbial biomass (qCO2), and the ratio of light particulate organic matter (POM-LF) to Corg. Ratios of soil microbial biomass (Cmic/Corg) and POM-LF (POM-LF/Corg) and the amount of decomposed YSOM were relatively similar to each other, despite differences in management practice and soil texture. Soil microbial parameters (Cmic, Cmic/Corg and qCO2) were significantly (p\&lt;0.05) affected by the amount of decomposed YSOM and the silt content in the OF. In the ICP, soil microbial parameters depended only on the amount of decomposed YSOM, which was considered to be a consequence of the more heterogeneous texture at the OF-sites. Management effects were detectable for no-tillage in the ICP leading to an accumulation of active SOM in the surface soil (0–10 cm). The ratio POM-LF/Corg showed no difference between G and OF despite markedly higher Corg-contents at the G-sites. Conclusively, all methods used indicate comparable SOM qualities for the three management systems, despite differences in soil texture and soil management during 7 years. Management practices seem to be well adapted to the site conditions.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms for C stabilization in soils have received much interest recently due to their relevance in the global C cycle. Here we review the mechanisms that are currently, but often contradictorily or inconsistently, considered to contribute to organic matter (OM) protection against decomposition in temperate soils: (i) selective preservation due to recalcitrance of OM, including plant litter, rhizodeposits, microbial products, humic polymers, and charred OM; (ii) spatial inaccessibility of OM against decomposer organisms due to occlusion, intercalation, hydrophobicity and encapsulation; and (iii) stabilization by interaction with mineral surfaces (Fe-, Al-, Mn-oxides, phyllosilicates) and metal ions. Our goal is to assess the relevance of these mechanisms to the formation of soil OM during different stages of decomposition and under different soil conditions. The view that OM stabilization is dominated by the selective preservation of recalcitrant organic components that accumulate in proportion to their chemical properties can no longer be accepted. In contrast, our analysis of mechanisms shows that: (i) the soil biotic community is able to disintegrate any OM of natural origin; (ii) molecular recalcitrance of OM is relative, rather than absolute; (iii) recalcitrance is only important during early decomposition and in active surface soils; while (iv) during late decomposition and in the subsoil, the relevance of spatial inaccessibility and organo-mineral interactions for SOM stabilization increases. We conclude that major difficulties in the understanding and prediction of SOM dynamics originate from the simultaneous operation of several mechanisms. We discuss knowledge gaps and promising directions of future research.},

The model concept relates the diverse stabilization mechanisms to active, intermediate, and passive pools. The formation of the passive pool is regarded as hierarchical structured co-action of various processes that are active under specific pedogenetic conditions. To evaluate the model, we used data of pool sizes and turnover times of soil OM fractions from horizons of two acid forest and two agricultural soils. Selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds is relevant in the active pool and particularly in soil horizons with high C contents. Biogenic aggregation preserves OM in the intermediate pool and is limited to topsoil horizons. Spatial inaccessibility due to the occlusion of OM in clay microstructures and due to the formation of hydrophobic surfaces stabilizes OM in the passive pool. If present, charcoal contributes to the passive pool mainly in topsoil horizons. The importance of organo-mineral interactions for OM stabilization in the passive pool is well-known and increases with soil depth. Hydrophobicity is particularly relevant in acid soils and in soils with considerable inputs of charcoal. We conclude that the stabilization potentials of soils are site- and horizon-specific. Furthermore, management affects key stabilization mechanisms. Tillage increases the importance of organo-mineral interactions for OM stabilization, and in Ap horizons with high microbial activity and C turnover, organo-mineral interactions can contribute to OM stabilization in the intermediate pool. The application of our model showed that we need a better understanding of processes causing spatial inaccessibility of OM to decomposers in the passive pool.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) represents one of the largest reservoirs of carbon on the global scale. Thus, the temperature sensitivity of bulk SOM and of different SOM fractions is a key factor determining the response of the terrestrial carbon balance to climatic warming. We condense the available knowledge about the potential temperature sensitivity and the actual temperature sensitivity of decomposition in situ, which ultimately depends on substrate availability. We review and evaluate contradictory results of estimates of the temperature sensitivity of bulk SOM and of different SOM fractions. The contradictory results demonstrate a need to focus research on biological and physicochemical controls of SOM stabilisation and destabilisation processes as a basis for understanding strictly causal relationships and kinetic properties of key processes that determine pool sizes and turnover rates of functional SOM pools. The current understanding is that temperature sensitivity of SOM mineralisation is governed by the following factors: (1) the stability of SOM, (2) the substrate availability, which is determined by the balance between input of organic matter, stabilisation and mineralisation of SOM, (3) the physiology of the soil microflora, its efficiency in substrate utilisation and its temperature optima and (4) physicochemical controls of destabilisation and stabilisation processes, like pH and limitation of water, oxygen and nutrient supply. As soil microflora is functionally omnipotent and most SOM is of high age and stability, the temperature dependence of stable SOM pools is the central question that determines C stocks and stock changes under global warming.},

  abstract = {Microplastics ({$<$}5~mm) are ubiquitous in the marine environment and are ingested by zooplankton with possible negative effects on survival, feeding, and fecundity. The majority of laboratory studies has used new and pristine microplastics to test their impacts, while aging processes such as weathering and biofouling alter the characteristics of plastic particles in the marine environment. We investigated zooplankton ingestion of polystyrene beads (15 and 30~μm) and fragments (≤30~μm), and tested the hypothesis that microplastics previously exposed to marine conditions (aged) are ingested at higher rates than pristine microplastics. Polystyrene beads were aged by soaking in natural local seawater for three weeks. Three zooplankton taxa ingested microplastics, excluding the copepod Pseudocalanus spp., but the proportions of individuals ingesting plastic and the number of particles ingested were taxon and life stage specific and dependent on plastic size. All stages of Calanus finmarchicus ingested polystyrene fragments. Aged microbeads were preferred over pristine ones by females of Acartia longiremis as well as juvenile copepodites CV and adults of Calanus finmarchicus. The preference for aged microplastics may be attributed to the formation of a biofilm. Such a coating, made up of natural microbes, may contain similar prey as the copepods feed on in the water column and secrete chemical exudates that aid chemodetection and thus increase the attractiveness of the particles as food items. Much of the ingested plastic was, however, egested within a short time period (2–4~h) and the survival of adult Calanus females was not affected in an 11-day exposure. Negative effects of microplastics ingestion were thus limited. Our findings emphasize, however, that aging plays an important role in the transformation of microplastics at sea and ingestion by grazers, and should thus be considered in future microplastics ingestion studies and estimates of microplastics transfer into the marine food web.},

  abstract = {BackgroundWhile the use of plastic materials has generated huge societal benefits, the ‘plastic age’ comes with downsides: One issue of emerging concern is the accumulation of plastics in the aquatic environment. Here, so-called microplastics (MP), fragments smaller than 5 mm, are of special concern because they can be ingested throughout the food web more readily than larger particles. Focusing on freshwater MP, we briefly review the state of the science to identify gaps of knowledge and deduce research needs.State of the scienceEnvironmental scientists started investigating marine (micro)plastics in the early 2000s. Today, a wealth of studies demonstrates that MP have ubiquitously permeated the marine ecosystem, including the polar regions and the deep sea. MP ingestion has been documented for an increasing number of marine species. However, to date, only few studies investigate their biological effects.The majority of marine plastics are considered to originate from land-based sources, including surface waters. Although they may be important transport pathways of MP, data from freshwater ecosystems is scarce. So far, only few studies provide evidence for the presence of MP in rivers and lakes. Data on MP uptake by freshwater invertebrates and fish is very limited.Knowledge gapsWhile the research on marine MP is more advanced, there are immense gaps of knowledge regarding freshwater MP. Data on their abundance is fragmentary for large and absent for small surface waters. Likewise, relevant sources and the environmental fate remain to be investigated. Data on the biological effects of MP in freshwater species is completely lacking. The accumulation of other freshwater contaminants on MP is of special interest because ingestion might increase the chemical exposure. Again, data is unavailable on this important issue.ConclusionsMP represent freshwater contaminants of emerging concern. However, to assess the environmental risk associated with MP, comprehensive data on their abundance, fate, sources, and biological effects in freshwater ecosystems are needed. Establishing such data critically depends on a collaborative effort by environmental scientists from diverse disciplines (chemistry, hydrology, ecotoxicology, etc.) and, unsurprisingly, on the allocation of sufficient public funding.},

The present study examines plastic particle concentrations and loads ({$>$} 500 µm) upstream and downstream of an urban subcatchment over 15 months and investigated the relationship between river water discharge (Q) and plastic concentration (C). The plastic particle concentration increases by 0.8 g/1000 m³ or 77 n/1000m³ from the rural to the urban subcatchment. In the rural subcatchment C does not increase with increasing Q (p=0.57), whereas a positive relationship between C and Q exists downstream of the urban catchment (p= 0.00003). Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) likely contribute additional plastic loads during high flow conditions. Based on the C-Q relationship, we estimate the total plastic export in 2016 from the entire catchment to be 3.0x106 n/year, or 2.6x104 n/(km² year) and 15 n/(cap year). Because of the positive C-Q relationship, 90\% of the plastic load is transported during 20\% of the time. The analysis of time-resolved plastic concentration data in rivers provides a data-driven tool to better estimate plastic loads and to better understand the catchment controls of plastic in rivers.},

The available information on properties and generation of TWP, analytical techniques to determine TWP, emissions, occurrence and behavior and ecotoxicological effects of TWP are reviewed with a focus on surface water as a potential receptor. TWP emissions are traffic related and contribute 5–30\% to non-exhaust emissions from traffic. The mass of TWP generated is estimated at 1,327,000 t/a for the European Union, 1,120,000 t/a for the United States and 133,000 t/a for Germany. For Germany, this is equivalent to four times the amount of pesticides used. The mass of TWP ultimately entering the aquatic environment strongly depends on the extent of collection and treatment of road runoff, which is highly variable. For the German highways it is estimated that up to 11,000 t/a of TWP reach surface waters. Data on TWP concentrations in the environment, including surface waters are fragmentary, which is also due to the lack of suitable analytical methods for their determination. Information on TWP properties such as density and size distribution are missing; this hampers assessing the fate of TWP in the aquatic environment. Effects in the aquatic environment may stem from TWP itself or from compounds released from TWP. It is concluded that reliable knowledge on transport mechanism to surface waters, concentrations in surface waters and sediments, effects of aging, environmental half-lives of TWP as well as effects on aquatic organisms are missing. These aspects need to be addressed to allow for the assessment of risk of TWP in an aquatic environment.},

Our results demonstrate the presence of nanoplastics with a size ranging from 20 to 150~nm and covering three of the most common plastic families: polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride. Given the amount of organic matter in the soil matrix, the discrimination and identification of large nanoplastic aggregates are challenging. However, we provided an innovative methodology to circumvent the organic matter impact on nanoplastic detection by coupling size fractionation to molecular analysis of plastics. While photodegradation has been considered the principal formation pathway of nanoplastics in the environment, this study provides evidence, for the first time, that plastic degradation and nanoplastic production can, however, occur in the soil matrix. Moreover, by providing an innovative and simple extraction/analysis method, this study paves the way to further studies, notably regarding nanoplastic environmental fate and impacts.},

The glass spheres were considered as an analogy for natural sediment and the results were afterward transferred to natural sediment and compared to fine sediment infiltration. The infiltration depth of the microplastic particles increased with decreasing diameter of the microplastic particles (dMP) and with increasing diameter of the glass spheres (dGS). At ratios of dMP/dGS {$>$} 0.32, hardly any infiltration could be observed. In regard to the particle shape, the data shows that spherical particles infiltrate deeper than fragments and fibers. In case of fibers, the fiber diameter, in particular, influences the depth of infiltration, with thinner fiber diameters leading to deeper infiltration depths. Fragments, such as tire abrasion, infiltrated less deeply than spherical particles, probably due to the entanglement of the angular particles in the pores. Finally, based on the experiments, this study provides initial indications of reasonable sampling depths in dependence of the grain sizes of the bottom sediment and the microplastic particles. According to this, microplastics in detectable particle sizes ({$>$}100 μm) are only found on the surface of sediment consisting of coarse silt and fine sand, while the particles might infiltrate up to 13 cm into sediment consisting of coarse sand, fine gravel, and medium gravel. A statement of depth-variable microplastic concentrations is therefore mainly useful for these sediment types. Accordingly, in future sediment samples, the grain size distribution of the sediment should always be indicated to better evaluate the detected microplastic concentrations.},

  abstract = {The products formed when a polymer is pyrolyzed depend firstly on the chemical identity of the polymer, but also on the nature of the pyrolysis, especially the temperature and heating rate. The relative abundance of specific compounds in the pyrolyzate may be related to the pyrolysis temperature in a linear way, so that a graph of the peak area ratios of these materials in the pyrogram versus the pyrolysis temperature produces a straight line. This has been shown to be the case for Kraton 1107 (a copolymer of styrene and isoprene) and for polyethylene among others. Generally, the ratio is made between the peak for a compound of relatively high molecular weight and one of low molecular weight, with the implication that at higher temperatures the larger molecules are being degraded to form more of the smaller products. Polyethylene reveals an interesting temperature-related phenomenon. When pyrolyzed, polyethylene produces linear hydrocarbons, namely alkanes, alkenes and terminally unsaturated diolefins. These hydrocarbons are typically present in all carbon chain lengths up to 30–40 carbons. The amount of diene generated (relative to the corresponding alkane) increases as the pyrolysis temperature is increased. A graph of the diene/alkane ratio versus the pyrolysis temperature shows that the relationship is linear in the range 600–1000° C. Data are shown regarding the temperature dependence of product ratios for polyethylene and poly(1-butene), as well as the generation of small molecules which may help clarify the pathways by which these products are formed.},

As widely used pesticides in vegetable farmland, carbendazim, dipterex, diflubenzuron, malathion, difenoconazole have potential environmental and human safety risks. They are often coexisting with MPs in the environment, and may cause consequential pollution to the ecosystem. Studying the adsorption behavior between pesticides and PE agricultural soil films MPs would be helpful for the risk assessment of co-exposure of pesticides and MPs. Herein, a systematic study on batch adsorption experiments was performed to determine the adsorption process of pesticides on MPs, the environmental factors on adsorption capacity were evaluated, and the adsorption mechanisms were discussed. Results suggested that all these five pesticides can adsorb on MPs, especially for diflubenzuron and difenoconazole. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitted to the Pseudo-second-order and Freundlich model, respectively, indicating that besides the adsorption onto surface sites, mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion were involved in the adsorption process, and the adsorption process was mostly controlled by physical and chemical interactions. The adsorption amounts of 5 pesticides on PE MPs follow the order of DIF~{$>~$}DIFE~{$>~$}MAL~{$>~$}CAR~{$>~$}DIP with KF correlated positively with octanol-water partition coefficients (LogKow). The thermodynamic study indicates the adsorption of all pesticides as spontaneous and exothermic processes. The results of this study illustrated that PE MPs can be a good carrier of pesticides in agricultural field.},

  abstract = {With the increasingly serious pollution of plastics, biodegradable plastics (BDPs) have attracted attention as a new material that can replace conventional plastics in certain applications. The global production of BDPs also gradually increases in recent years. However, unfortunately, with the application of BDPs, some potential problems are gradually exposed. The biodegradability of BDPs needs suitable conditions, which is difficult for the natural environment to reach the necessary conditions. If the degradation conditions are not met, BDPs and conventional plastics are basically the same in terms of the longevity. The biodegradable microplastics (BMPs) can also be formed by BDPs entering the environment. Up to now, the research on the degradation and application of BDPs is relatively common. The environmental and ecological effects of the BMPs, the adsorption and release of toxic substances, and the role of BMPs as vectors of microorganisms, epiphytes, and plants still need to be studied. This paper focuses on the formation mechanism and the environmental behavior of BMPs. The role of BMPs as multiple stronger vectors of microorganisms and pollutants compared to conventional microplastics is also discussed. Systematic research on environmental pollution and ecotoxicology of BMPs should be carried out as soon as possible.},

The objective of this study was to determine the fraction of soil water that is bound to soil colloids using the thermogravimetry (TG) technique. A heating program from room temperature (RT) to 200°C was developed to partition bound water into loosely bound water (equivalent to water content determined by conventional oven-drying method) and tightly bound water that was not accounted by conventional oven-drying method on original and organic matter (OM) removed soil samples. Nine air-dry soils, with varying amounts of clay and OM contents, were tested. For the original air-dry samples, bound water content ranged from 0.54 to 5.22\%, and the fractions of loosely and tightly bound water were about 80 and 20\%, respectively. On a mass fraction basis, the specific water adsorption capacity of soil OM was 10 to 40 times that of soil minerals. For most mineral soils, however, the contribution of soil minerals to bound water ({$>$}70\%) was much larger than that of soil OM ({$<$}30\%), since the mineral fraction usually dominates over the OM fraction. In a soil with high OM concentration but a relatively low clay content, OM contribution to bound water exceeded 50\%. Soil specific surface area (SA) showed a strong influence on bound water content, and a linear relationship between SA and bound water content was established.},

  abstract = {Mulching in vegetable cultivation has been widely used to conserve water and improve yield. Field experiments with four treatments, including yard waste compost combined with plastic mulches in raised beds for winter fresh market bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L.), were conducted at two experimental sites [Pine Island Farm (Pin and Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC)] in Miami-Dade county for two different years each. The treatments were: 1) control (PM): plastic mulch alone; 2) MC33: fumigation of the soil with a mixture of methyl bromide and chloropicrin and covered with plastic mulch; 3) herbicide/OM: organic mulch sprayed with herbicides (S-metolachlor and napropamide) without plastic mulch; and 4) PM/OM: organic mulch covered by plastic mulch. The treatment of PM/OM at both experimental sites in 2 years each increased the total marketable yields of bell pepper by 1.5- to 3.2-fold, total extra large fruit yields by 2.0- to 5.7-fold, and total large fruit yields by 1.4- to 2.6-fold, respectively, on average compared with the control, although some exceptions occurred between the two years at the TREC site. Under most circumstances at both experimental sites in two different years each, the PM/OM treatment also improved the total marketable yield and fruit quality (such as extra large fruits) for the first two harvests, which shows a preference to provide winter fresh market vegetables to meet a high demand. The economic benefit by PM/OM was the greatest among all the treatments. The results suggest that the application of organic mulch combined with plastic mulch can improve bell pepper yield and quality as a result of the improvement of soil fertility, especially the early harvests of winter fresh market fruits, which has shown a potential in the development of sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract = {A laboratory-scale study was performed to compare the emissions of pollutants from the batch combustion of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and to examine the conditions that minimize them. Fixed beds of polymer particles were burned in a two-stage, preheated muffle furnace, using air at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the primary furnace was varied over a range of 500?1000 °C, to identify its influence on the emission of pollutants. The combustion effluent was mixed with additional preheated air, channeled to a secondary muffle furnace (afterburner), which was operated at 1000 °C. Emissions of CO, CO2, light hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulates were monitored either on-line or by sample collection, followed by gas chromatographic analysis. Emission magnitudes and trends were found to be dependent on the type of the polymer burned. The combustion of PS produced the largest yields of PAHs and, especially, soot; PE produced the next-largest yields, followed by those from PVC. Emissions of CO were the highest from PE. As the temperature of the primary furnace increased, (a) particulate emissions from burning PS and PVC generally increased, while the trend of PE was ambivalent; (b) PAH emissions from PS and PE increased, whereas those from PVC rather decreased; and (c) the trends of CO with temperature were not monotonic. Additional treatment of the combustion effluent in the afterburner led to a decrease of particulate and PAH emissions from PS and PVC, whereas those from PE decreased at low primary furnace temperatures but increased at high temperatures. CO emissions from PVC decreased in the afterburner, but those from PS and PE generally increased. The trends of emissions monitored at the exit of the afterburner paralleled those at the exit of the primary furnace, as the temperature of the primary furnace was varied. Given the aforementioned trends, it appears that operation of the primary furnace at a relatively low temperature, in the vicinity of 600 °C, allows the afterburner to operate under conditions suitable for minimizing most emissions for all three polymers. A detailed kinetic model, comprised of more than 1100 chemical reactions, was used for the description of the afterburner. For this purpose, the afterburner was approximated as a steady-state plug-flow reactor. Measured concentrations of O2, CO, CO2, light hydrocarbons, and PAHs at the inlet of the afterburner were integrated over the duration of the combustion event and used as input to the model calculation. Oxidation of PAHs, their conversion to soot, and the oxidation of soot were added to a previously developed model that included PAH formation. The model was tested for the case of PE incineration, and its predictions were qualitatively consistent with experimental data.}

In this work, samples from six land-use types were collected from Chinese farmlands in five provinces. It was found that MP abundances were in the range of 2783–6366 items/kg in all samples. MP distribution results showed that over 80\% of particles were less than 1~mm, and that MP sizes ranging between 0.02 and 0.2~mm represented the greatest proportion. The particle shape classified as fragment (with edges and angular) was the most frequent shape, with an abundance of approximately 54.05\%. Polyethylene (PE) and polyamides (PA) were the most abundant polymers in cropped lands; 20.88\% and 20.31\%, respectively. Statistical analyses showed that lands used for plastic mulching (mulch film and greenhouse crops) had a significantly higher particle abundance, hence identifying plastic mulching as a major contributor to MP pollution in agricultural lands. Furthermore, paddy lands had a significantly higher MP abundance than wheat lands. Variation analyses of MP characteristics revealed that cereal crop farmlands (wheat, paddy land) were more likely to contain fibrous shapes and large MP particles (1–5~mm). Economically important tree lands (orchards, woodlands) were likely to contain fragment shapes and pony-size MPs (0.02–0.2~mm). Discrepancies among farmlands may depend on various reasons, such as mulching plastic application, irrigation, atmospheric fallout, etc. This study provides firsthand evidences about the characteristics of MP pollution in farmlands and explores some predominant MP sources in agroecosystems.},

In recent years, MPs in soil and their adverse effects on soil health and fertility have attracted increasing concern. Based on the current knowledge, this review begins with a summary of the occurrence and characteristics of MPs in various soil environments, and then highlights the impacts of MPs on soil physical, chemical, and microbiological properties. Data show that MPs occur widely in all surveyed soil types, such as agricultural soils, industrial soils, urban soils, and unused soils, but show variation in their abundance, type, shape, and size. In most cases, MPs can change soil physical, chemical, and microbiological properties, but the effects vary, and are dependent on polymer type, shape, dose, and size. MPs-induced changes in soil fertility and the availability of pollutants may pose a potential threat to plant performance and crop productivity and safety. Particularly, MPs influence the emission of greenhouse gases from soil, ultimately leading to uncertain consequences for global climate change. More comprehensive and in-depth studies are required to fill large knowledge gaps.},

To estimate the response of soil bacterial community succession and temporal turnover to microplastic amendment, a soil microcosm experiment was carried out with polyethylene microplastics. The soil samples under control and microplastic amendment conditions were collected for sequencing analysis using Illumina MiSeq technology. Microplastic amendment was found to significantly alter soil bacterial community structure, and the community differences were increased linearly with the incubation time. Compared with the turnover rate of bacterial community in the control samples (0.0103, p~{$<~$}.05, based on Bray-Curtis similarity), the succession rate was significantly (p~{$<~$}.001) higher in the soil with microplastic amendment (0.0309, p~{$<~$}.001). In addition, the effects of microplastic amendment on the time-decay relationships (TDRs) on taxonomic divisions revealed considerable variations of TDRs values, indicating the effects were lineage dependent. Our results propose that the presence of microbial in soil ecosystem may lead to a faster succession rate of soil bacterial community, which provides new insights into the evolutionary consequences of microplastics in terrestrial environment.},

Although their occurrence and spatial distribution have been extensively studied in recent years, the relationship between their abundance and sizes remains unclear. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms dominating their size distribution have rarely been explored. In the present study, we developed a novel conditional fragmentation model to describe MP size distribution in the soil environment. It is proposed that the distribution of MPs is not a coincidence but controlled by conditional aging. The applicability of this model was tested using data collected from different land use settings in Beijing, China. A distinct downsizing phenomenon from fibers, films, and fragments to granules is observed. Undisturbed land use types accumulated larger sized MPs with higher stability, while human interference accelerated the fragmentation of MPs. Both morphological analysis and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) observations provided direct evidence for the conditional fragmentation process. Furthermore, the model has proven to be suitable for describing the size distribution of MPs from various sources (including atmospheric deposition, transportation, and agriculture) and aging processes (such as mechanical abrasion, chemical oxidation, and photochemical transformation). It is proposed that this model can be used for various purposes in MP-related studies, especially source identification, transport modeling, and risk assessment.},

Although no standard method has been established so far, flotation is commonly used to separate plastic from mineral material. The objective of this study was to test the efficiency of flotation for the extraction of nano- and microplastics from biosolids and soil. We spiked biosolids and soil samples with polystyrene nano- and microbeads (0.05, 1.0, 2.6, 4.8, and 100 μm diameter). Different extraction methods (w/ and w/o H2O2 digestion) were tested, and plastic beads were separated from mineral particles by flotation in a ZnCl2 solution. Plastic particles were quantified by UV-Vis spectrometry and gravimetrically. While large beads (100 μm) could be quantitatively extracted (∼100\%) from both biosolids and soils, smaller beads had low extraction efficiencies (ranging from 5 to 80\%, with an average of 20\%). Except for the 100 μm beads, oxidation with H2O2 negatively impacted the extraction efficiencies. For the soil, extraction with water only, followed by flotation in a ZnCl2 solution, resulted in relatively high extraction efficiencies ({$>$}75\%) for beads larger than 1 μm, but low efficiencies ({$<$}30\%) for the 0.05 and 1.0 μm beads. Our results indicate that while flotation generally works to separate plastic nano- and microbeads in a solution, the challenge is to quantitatively extract nano- and microbeads from a biosolids or soil matrix. Samples high in organic matter content require removal of the organic matter, but the common method of H2O2 oxidation leads to poor extraction efficiencies for nano- and microbeads.},

Plastics are polymers with different degrees of polymerization. In this study, alkali-assisted thermal hydrolysis was applied to depolymerize two plastics containing ester groups, polycarbonate (PC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), in a pentanol or butanol system. By determining the concentrations of the depolymerized building block compounds, i.e., bisphenol A and p-phthalic acid, we quantified the amounts of PC and PET MPs in environmental samples. Recoveries of 87.2–97.1\% were obtained for the PC and PET plastic particles spiked in the landfill sludge. The method was successfully applied to determine the occurrence of PC and PET MPs in samples of sludge, marine sediments, indoor dust, digestive residues in mussel and clam, and sea salt and rock salt. High concentrations of 246 and 430 mg/kg were determined for PC and PET type MPs, respectively, in an indoor dust. In addition, concentrations of 63.7 mg/kg for PC and 127 mg/kg for PET were detected in the digestive residues of a clam.},

  abstract = {The effects of plastic mulch in Hawaiian pineapple culture on runoff generation and soil erosion are poorly understood and not covered in the literature. Field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on an Oxisol commonly used in Hawaii for pineapple production. Four treatments were no cover (hereafter called bare), plastic mulch as the sole cover (plastic), pineapple crowns as the sole cover (crown), and both plastic and crowns as covers (plastic–crown). The average slope of these plots was 4.2\% and all were shaped into ridge-and-furrow configurations. For each treatment, three successive storms were imposed: a `dry run' with an intensity of 35 mm h−1 on the initially dry soil; a `wet run' with the same intensity on the following day; and a `very wet run' with an intensity of 62 mm h−1 that immediately followed the wet run. Runoff was measured and sampled every 5–10 min until a steady state was reached. Results indicated that plastic mulch itself substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion due to its impervious nature. The simultaneous presence of plastic mulch and pineapple crowns, however, tended to retard runoff generation and reduce soil erosion. For all storms, runoff and erosion rates in the plastic–crown plot were smaller than those of the bare and the crown plots (ca. 30 ∔ 50\% less) due to the formed micro-basins in plastic–crown system that enhanced infiltration. Plots without plastic mulch displayed soil surface sealing that impeded infiltration. The practical implication of the research is that the plastic mulch used in Hawaiian pineapple plantations may not necessarily increase runoff and soil erosion.},

Microplastics have been shown to sorb chemical pollutants from their surrounding environment, thus raising concern as to their role in the movement of these pollutants through the food chain. This experiment investigated whether organic pollutants sorbed to microbeads (MBs) from personal care products were assimilated by fish following particle ingestion. Rainbow fish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) were exposed to MBs with sorbed polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs; BDE-28, -47, -100, -99, -153, -154, -183, 200 ng g–1; BDE-209, 2000 ng g–1) and sampled at 0, 21, 42, and 63 days along with two control treatments (food only and food + clean MBs). Exposed fish had significantly higher Σ8PBDE concentrations than both control treatments after just 21 days, and continued exposure resulted in increased accumulation of the pollutants over the experiment (ca. 115 pg g–1 ww d–1). Lower brominated congeners showed the highest assimilation whereas higher brominated congeners did not appear to transfer, indicating they may be too strongly sorbed to the plastic or unable to be assimilated by the fish due to large molecular size or other factors. Seemingly against this trend, however, BDE-99 did not appear to bioaccumulate in the fish, which may be due to partitioning from the MBs or it being metabolized in vivo. This work provides evidence that MBs from personal care products are capable of transferring sorbed pollutants to fish that ingest them.},

Here, we show that polystyrene is completely photochemically oxidized to carbon dioxide and partially photochemically oxidized to dissolved organic carbon. Lifetimes of complete and partial photochemical oxidation are estimated to occur on centennial and decadal time scales, respectively. These lifetimes are orders of magnitude faster than biological respiration of polystyrene and thus challenge the prevailing assumption that polystyrene persists in the environment for millennia. Additives disproportionately altered the relative susceptibility to complete and partial photochemical oxidation of polystyrene and accelerated breakdown by shifting light absorbance and reactivity to longer wavelengths. Polystyrene photochemical oxidation increased approximately 25\% with a 10 °C increase in temperature, indicating that temperature is unlikely to be a primary driver of photochemical oxidation rates. Collectively, sunlight exposure appears to be a governing control of the environmental persistence of polystyrene, and thus, photochemical loss terms need to be included in mass balance studies on the environmental fate of polystyrene. The experimental framework presented herein should be applied to a diverse array of polymers and formulations to establish how general these results are for other plastics in the environment.},

  abstract = {Double-cropping of plastic (polyethylene) mulches has the potential to increase the cost-effectiveness while reducing the environmental impact of this technology for enhancing growth of vegetable crops. In regions with a short growing season, double-cropping of soil mulches hinges on being able to leave the plastic in the field over winter. This extended exposure to the elements may alter the physical and optical characteristics of the mulch, thereby influencing crop productivity in the second year of use. This study evaluated the physical characteristics and efficacy of black, clear and infrared transmitting (IRT) mulches over two cropping seasons in Saskatchewan. The crops planted were pepper (Capsicum annuum) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) in the first year and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) in the second year. Early-season soil temperatures appeared highest under the clear mulch in the first year, but once the crop canopy was established there was little difference in soil temperature among plots having different mulches. Higher yields of both cucumber and pepper were produced in the first year by clear mulch than by black mulch or without mulch. All mulches were still physically sound at the end of the first growing season, but light transmission through the clear and IRT mulches was reduced relative to new mulch. Much of this change was due to soil and other debris on the surface of the mulches. There was little further change in the physical condition or light transmission characteristics of the mulches through the second year of use. Weed growth under clear mulch in its second year appeared to reduce soil temperatures, particularly relative to new clear mulch. Mulch type, either newly laid or year-old, had no impact on yields of marketable tomatoes. More fruit reached full red color prior to harvest in response to clear mulch than to no mulch (bare soil). Yields of marketable tomato fruit obtained on year-old mulch of all types were comparable to yields obtained with new mulch. These data suggest that double-cropping of plastic mulches can be done without loss of crop yield and provide significant savings in materials, labor and disposal costs. While clear mulch was generally the most beneficial for the production of warm season vegetable crops, it did not prevent weed growth in the second year which was problematic.},

Knowledge of the fate of these plastics in regularly-amended soils is thus an issue for the environmental management of these soils. The aims of this study were 1) to develop a method combining soil fractionation, microscopic observation and chemical characterization to follow the fate of plastics in soils and 2) to apply this method on a long-term experimental field, where municipal solid waste composts were applied every other year during 10 years. The presence of plastics was investigated within compost and soil fractions using morphological and analytical characterization by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM-EDX) and pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS). Specific features of plastics allowed us to distinguish these polymers from soil organic matter even in the {$<$}200 µm soil fractions. Ti and Ba detection associated with these features, as they are initially added during the polymer production, also constituted plastic tracers within organo-mineral fractions. Plastic fragments as detected by TEM were less abundant in the fine soil fractions compared to the coarsest ones. The abundance of styrene produced upon pyrolysis, used as a molecular tracer of plastics, also decreased relative to produced toluene according to the same particle size gradient. Our results evidenced that plastics and microplastics were present in the soil that was amended for 10 years with compost, while not in the control soil. MPs were mostly observed as individualized particles, present in the coarsest fractions as well as some of the fine soil fractions, but they were little associated with the soil matrix. They mostly did not show any degradation features such as microbial lysis. We thus suggest that their evolution in soil was mainly due to fragmentation. Our methodological approach provides tools to monitor the fate of microplastics over time and specify the contribution of such contaminants in soil amended with bio-based products.},

  abstract = {The microplastic (MP) contamination of oceans, freshwaters, and soils has become one of the major challenges within the Anthropocene. MP is transported in large quantities through river systems from land to sea and is deposited in river sediments and floodplains. As part of the river system, floodplains and their soils are known for their sink function with respect to sediments, nutrients, and pollutants. However, the questions remain: To what extend does this deposition occur in floodplain soils? Which spatial distribution of MP accumulations, resulting from possible environmental drivers, can be found? The present study analyzes the spatial distribution of large (L-MP, 2000–1000~μm) and medium (M-MP, 1000–500~μm) MP particles in floodplain soils of the Lahn River (Germany). Based on a geospatial sampling concept, the MP contents in floodplain soils are investigated down to a depth of 2~m through a combined method approach, including MP analyses, soil surveys, properties, and sediment dating. The analysis of the plastic particles was carried out by density separation, visual fluorescence identification, and ATR-FTIR analysis. In addition, grain-size analyses and 210Pb and 137Cs dating were performed to reconstruct the MP deposition conditions. The results prove a more frequent accumulation of MP in upper floodplain soils (0–50~cm) deposited by flood dynamics since the 1960s than in subsoils. The first MP detection to a depth of 2~m and below recent ({$>$}1960) sediment accumulation indicates in-situ vertical transfer of mobile MP particles through natural processes (e.g., preferential flow, bioturbation). Furthermore, the role of MP as a potential marker of the Anthropocene is assessed. This study advances our understanding of the deposition and relocation of MP at the aquatic-terrestrial interface.},

So far, mainly 'explorative studies' have been carried out to detect microplastics in different soil environments. To generate a deeper understanding of microplastics dynamics, 'systematic studies' are required. Such research must built on a targeted sampling strategy and considerate fieldwork and sample handling. From literature enquiry, a five-stage methodological workflow was deduced for studies on microplastics in soils. In the present review, the spatial representation of soils/soilscapes with microplastics in soils research is conceptually and practically assessed. We discuss judgmental, randomized, and metric soil sampling strategies. Then, we explain sample pre-processing and give a brief overview of methods for microplastics identification and quantification. We conclude that the establishment of the novel field of research 'microplastic dynamics in soils' requires more intensive consideration of soil sampling strategies. As soil is a complex medium and the soilscape is spatially heterogeneous, we highlight systematic sampling strategies as the best possible options for sophisticated research. However, no overall optimum methodology can be defined because the specific strategy must be in line with the particular research question. For all studies on microplastics in soils, practical improvement is needed to prevent contamination of soil samples with plastics during sampling and sample pre-processing.},

After the detection of microplastics in soils, spatial distribution and dynamics are still unknown. However, the potential risks associated with plastic particles in soils cannot be sufficiently assessed without knowledge about the spatial distribution of these anthropogenic materials. Based on a spatial research approach, including soil surveys, this study quantified the mesoplastic (MEP, {$>$} 5.0~mm) and coarse microplastics (CMP, 2.0–5.0~mm) content of twelve floodplain soils. At four transects in the catchment area of the Lahn river (Germany), soils down to a depth of 2~m were examined for plastic content for the first time. MEP and CMP were detected through visual examination after sample preprocessing and ATR-FTIR analyses. Average MEP and CMP concentrations range between 2.06~kg−1 (±1.55~kg−1) and 1.88~kg−1 (±1.49~kg−1) with maximal values of 5.37 MEP kg−1 to 8.59 CMP kg−1. Plastic particles are heterogeneously distributed in samples. Both plastic size classes occur more frequently in topsoils than in soil layers deeper than 30~cm. The maximal depth of CMP occurrence lies between 75 and 100~cm. Most common CMP polymer type was PE-LD, followed by PP and PA. MEP and CMP particles occur frequently at near channel sides and more often on riparian strips or grassland than on farmland. Vertical distribution of CMP indicates anthropogenic relocation in topsoils and additional deep displacement through natural processes like preferential flow paths or bioturbation. By comparing sedimentation rates of the river with the maximum age of plastic particles, sedimentation as a deposition process of plastic in floodplains becomes probable. From our findings, it can be concluded that an overall widespread but spatial heterogenous contamination occurs in floodplain soils. Additionally, a complex plastic source pattern seems to appear in floodplain areas.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Plastic floating at the ocean surface, estimated at tens to hundreds of thousands of metric tons, represents only a small fraction of the estimated several million metric tons annually discharged by rivers. Such an imbalance promoted the search for a missing plastic sink that could explain the rapid removal of river-sourced plastics from the ocean surface. On the basis of an in-depth statistical reanalysis of updated data on microplastics—a size fraction for which both ocean and river sampling rely on equal techniques—we demonstrate that current river flux assessments are overestimated by two to three orders of magnitude. Accordingly, the average residence time of microplastics at the ocean surface rises from a few days to several years, strongly reducing the theoretical need for a missing sink.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The contamination of the environment with microplastic, defined as particles smaller than 5 mm, has emerged as a global challenge because it may pose risks to biota and public health. Current research focuses predominantly on aquatic systems, whereas comparatively little is known regarding the sources, pathways, and possible accumulation of plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated the potential of organic fertilizers from biowaste fermentation and composting as an entry path for microplastic particles into the environment. Particles were classified by size and identified by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. All fertilizer samples from plants converting biowaste contained plastic particles, but amounts differed significantly with substrate pretreatment, plant, and waste (for example, household versus commerce) type. In contrast, digestates from agricultural energy crop digesters tested for comparison contained only isolated particles, if any. Among the most abundant synthetic polymers observed were those used for common consumer products. Our results indicate that depending on pretreatment, organic fertilizers from biowaste fermentation and composting, as applied in agriculture and gardening worldwide, are a neglected source of microplastic in the environment. Organic fertilizer from recycled biowaste was identified as a vehicle for entry of microplastic particles into the environment.

  abstract = {Noise is a known drawback in the mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic data. Different techniques exist to avoid or to remove noise before and after data acquisition. Noise occurs in two different types, electronic and chemical. The former can be lowered by applying smoothing filters. The latter needs more sophisticated methods since the distinction between chemical noise and real chromatographic data is not straightforward. Several approaches have been published with different scopes and algorithms. This work describes a new algorithm (NOISERA – Noise Reduction Algorithm) for a dynamic reduction of chemical noise in mass spectrometric, chromatographic data of nominal mass resolution. It offers an approach to detect and to reduce chemical noise with a minimum of required user interaction and adjustments. Due to the assumption, that chemical noise varies in its intensity and is dependent of the time, the algorithm tries to calculate and reduce noise locally along the retention time axis. Electronic noise will not be covered by the presented algorithm. It can be reduced by applying further filters, since OpenChrom provides methods for smoothing. The presented algorithm NOISERA is capable of reducing noise with minimal user interaction. It combines existing ideas and extends them to achieve a parameter-free chemical noise detection and reduction. NOISERA improves the signal-to-noise ratio of peaks, but as a drawback of all chemical noise filters, it tends to remove either too much, respectively, not enough data from chromatograms than necessary. That is why the algorithm should not be used without supervision of an analyst. The noise reduction filter NOISERA is available as a plug-in for OpenChrom and is released under the Eclipse Public License 1.0 (EPL). OpenChrom is available free of charge at http://www.openchrom.net. The noise reduction algorithm NOISERA is included in the latest OpenChrom release.},

This review concentrates on examples involving a combination of two or more of these effects, and with the consequential changes in engineering properties. Events on the molecular level lead to change in the morphology and macroscopic physical properties. For example, in a semi-crystalline polymer, chain scission caused by photo-oxidation, may lead to secondary crystallisation (‘chemi-crystallisation’), increasing density, and causing an increase in Young’s modulus and reducing ductility. Similar effects may be observed in glassy polymers, due to chain scission accelerating physical ageing. Such effects are particularly common when rapid cooling during moulding has left the polymer in a state far from equilibrium. A common symptom is a change in the residual stress distribution in polymer mouldings and this is discussed. To cite this article: J.R. White, C. R. Chimie 9, 2006.},

We have examined concentrations, storage, and turnover times of nutrients in the organic layer and the fluxes of nutrients by the fall of small litter (leaves, seeds, flowers, small twigs, and plant debris that passed an opening of 0.3~m × 0.3~m) in such a forest in Ecuador. The times taken for litter to turn over were estimated by relating nutrient storage in the organic layer to rate of litterfall and by incubating samples in the laboratory. The organic layer had a thickness of 2–43~cm, a mass of 30–713~t ha−1, and a nutrient storage of 0.87–21~t N, 0.03–0.70~t P, 0.12–2.5~t K, 0.09–3.2~t Ca, and 0.07–1.0~t Mg ha−1. The pH (in H2O) ranged between 3.1 and 7.4 and was correlated with the concentrations of Ca and Mg (r={$\mkern1mu$}0.83 and 0.84, respectively). The quantity of small litter (8.5–9.7~t year−1) and mean concentrations of nutrients in litter (19–22~g N, 0.9–1.6~g P, 6.1–9.1~g K, 12–18~g Ca, and 3.5–5.8~g~Mg~kg−1) were larger than in many other tropical montane forests.

Under optimum conditions in the laboratory, the mineralization of S was just as large as the S deposition by litterfall. In weakly acid soils Mn and Zn and in strongly acid soils Ca added in a nutrient solution were immobilized during incubation. Thus, lack of S, Mn, Zn, and Ca might limit plant growth on some soils.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is distributed across the globe, but compared with marine environments, there is only rudimentary understanding of the distribution and effects of plastics in other ecosystems. Here, we review the transport and effects of plastics across terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. We focus on hydrological catchments as well-defined landscape units that provide an integrating scale at which plastic pollution can be investigated and managed. Diverse processes are responsible for the observed ubiquity of plastic pollution, but sources, fluxes and sinks in river catchments are poorly quantified. Early indications are that rivers are hotspots of plastic pollution, supporting some of the highest recorded concentrations. River systems are also likely pivotal conduits for plastic transport among the terrestrial, floodplain, riparian, benthic and transitional ecosystems with which they connect. Although ecological effects of micro- and nano-plastics plastics might arise through a variety of physical and chemical mechanisms, consensus and understanding of their nature, severity and scale is restricted. Furthermore, whilst individual-level effects are often graphically represented in public media, knowledge of the extent and severity of the impacts of plastic at population, community and ecosystem levels is limited. Given the potential social, ecological and economic consequences, we call for more comprehensive investigations of plastic pollution in ecosystems to guide effective management action and risk assessment. This is reliant on (i) expanding research to quantify sources, sinks, fluxes and fates of plastics in catchments and transitional waters both independently as a major transport routes to marine ecosystems; (ii) improving environmentally relevant dose-response relationships for different organisms and effect pathways, (iii) scaling up from studies on individual organisms to populations and ecosystems, where individual effects are shown to cause harm; and (iv) improving biomonitoring through developing ecologically relevant metrics based on contemporary plastic research.

Wood plastic composites (WPCs) are an ideal combination of these raw materials, which can be produced with standard plastic technology such as extrusion or injection moulding. Wood to plastic ratio in a WPC influences quality and price, thus adaptation of analytical tools for material testing and quality assurance is required. In this study, the suitability of analytical pyrolysis (Py) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was investigated to quantify the amount of polypropylene (PP) in WPCs. The reliability of these methods was tested by analysing WPCs with different ratios of wood and PP. The amount of PP can be determined with DSC based on its melting point as the influence of wood is negligible in this context. The increment of typical PP markers and decrement of wood markers was observed and quantified in the pyrograms if the PP content in WPCs was elevated. Thus, the ratio of PP and wood can be reliably quantified by means of online and offline analytical pyrolysis.},

There is a high risk of sample contamination during sampling, sample preparation and analysis. In this study, the potential of sample contamination or misinterpretation due to substances associated to disposable laboratory gloves or reagents used during sample preparation, was investigated. Leachates of ten different types of disposable gloves were analysed using Raman microspectroscopy (µ-Raman), Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (µ-FTIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyr GC/MS). There appeared to be Polyethylene (PE) in almost all investigated glove leachates and with all applied methods. Closer investigations revealed that the leachates contained long-chain compounds such as stearates or fatty acids, which were falsely identified as PE by the applied analytical methods. Sodium dodecyl sulphate, which is commonly applied in microplastic research during sample preparation, may also be mistaken for PE. Therefore, µ-Raman, µ-FTIR and pyr-GC/MS were further tested for their capability to distinguish between PE, sodium dodecyl sulphate and stearates. It became clear, that stearates and sodium dodecyl sulphates can cause substantial overestimation of PE.},

Incidental contamination is highly likely unless strict control measures are employed. Here we describe methods developed to minimize the amount of incidental post-sampling contamination when quantifying marine microfibre pollution. We show that our protocol, adapted from the field of forensic fibre examination, reduces fibre abundance by 90\% and enables the quick screening of fibre populations. These methods therefore allow an accurate estimate of microplastics polluting marine sediments. In a case study from a series of samples collected on a research vessel, we use these methods to highlight the prevalence of microfibres as marine microplastics. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Images from scanning electron microscope, Lysogeny Broth agar plates and confocal laser scanning microscope indicated that all polymer slices incubated in biotic sediments were colonized by microorganisms, particularly the LDPE slices. The occurrence of biofilms induced higher dissipation rates of DDTs and PAHs from the LDPE slice surfaces incubated in the biotic sediments than in the abiotic sediments. Plastic colonization on LDPE slice surfaces enhanced the biotransformation of DDT and some PAHs in both marine and river sediments, but had little impact on PCBs. By comparison, PP and POM with unique properties were shown to exert different impacts on the physical and microbial activities as compared to LDPE. These results clearly demonstrated that the significance of polymer surface affiliated microbes to the environmental fate and behavior of organic contaminants should be recognized.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and more abundant in the marine environment. Consequently, increasing focus has been put on MPs in oceans and seas, while little importance has been attached to their presence in freshwaters and soils. Therefore, this paper aimed to provide a comprehensive review of the occurrence, analysis and ecotoxicology of MPs. The abundance and distribution of MPs in several typical freshwater systems of China were summarized. It suggested that the surface water of Poyang Lake contained the highest concentration of 34 items/L MPs among all the 8 freshwater systems, and the content of MPs in sediments were higher than that of the surface water. Net-based zooplankton sampling methods are the most frequently utilized sampling methods for MPs, and density separation, elutriation and digestion are three major pretreatment methods. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry are often used to identify the polymer types of MPs. Besides, MPs might damage the digestive tract of various organisms and negatively inhibit their growth, feeding and reproduction. The ways of human exposure to MPs are by ingestion, inhalation and dermal exposure, digestive and respiratory system might be adversely influenced. However, potential health risks of MPs to humans are remained insufficiently researched. Overall, by showing the presence of MPs in freshwaters and soils as well as possible ecotoxicological effects on the environment and humans, this paper provided a framework for future research in this field.},

  abstract = {Nanoplastics as emerging pollutants have caused growing concerns and posed potential threats to the environment. Nonetheless, only few studies investigated transport behaviors of nanoplastics in natural soils. In this study, column experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of soil properties, ionic strength and cation type on the transport of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) in a desert soil (DS), a black soil (BS) and a red soil (RS). The effluent recovery of PSNPs in three soils followed the order of DS (0\%–96.8\%)~{$>~$}BS (0\%–87.5\%)~{$>~$}RS (0\%). The retention of PSNPs was positively correlated with Fe/Al oxides contents (DS: Fe-2.69\%, Al-12.6\%; BS: Fe-4.04\%, Al-15.9\%; RS: Fe-6.57\%, Al-26.9\%), whereas negatively correlated with soil pH (DS: 9.75; BS: 6.57; RS: 4.97). Soil minerals and pH were thus identified as the crucial soil properties determining transport of PSNPs, due to their coupled effects on surface charges to affect electrostatic interactions between soils and PSNPs. In addition, increasing solution ionic strength strongly inhibited the transport of PSNPs in the DS (0\%–96.8\%) and BS (0\%–87.5\%). Ca2+ (IS: 1–5~mM) was more pronounced in enhancing PSNP retention than Na+ (IS: 1–20~mM). Our findings highlight that the transport and fate of PSNPs in natural soils are highly sensitive to soil physicochemical properties, ionic strength and cation type, and reveal that nanoplastics have strong mobility ability in soils with high pH and low Fe/Al oxides contents, which may pose potential risks to the soil and groundwater environment.},

The amount of DEHP that accumulated in leaves, stems, and fruits was mainly dependent upon exposure time, and most DEHP accumulated in their inner tissues. A single plant of B. hispida with a gourd was able to absorb more than 700 mg of DEHP when it was exposed to DEHP-contaminated air for 6 week. B. hispida reduced air DEHP concentration by 65?76\% as the air DEHP concentration ranged from 2351 to 3955 ?g/m3 (high DEHP level) and 85?92\% as the air DEHP concentration ranged from 35.1 to 65.3 ?g/m3 (low DEHP level) in greenhouse experiments. When intercropping of B. hispida and Brassica chinensis or Brassica campestris, B. hispida reduced more than 87\% of DEHP accumulation in the latter, which indicates that B. hispida has excellent use potential for lowering the DEHP content of intercropped vegetables.},

With the increasing body of evidence about the pollution and hazards of microplastics, microplastics have drawn major attention from governments and the scientific community. As a kind of emerging and persistent environmental pollutants, microplastics have recently been detected on a variety of substrates in the world. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress in identifying the sources of microplastics in soil, water, and atmosphere and describing the transport and fate of microplastics in the terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric ecosystems for revealing the circulation of microplastics in the ecosystem. In addition, considering the persistence of microplastics, this study elucidates the interactions of microplastics with other pollutants in the environment (i.e., organic pollutants, heavy metals) with emphasis on toxicity and accumulation, providing a novel insight into the ecological risks of microplastics in the environment. The negative impacts of microplastics on organisms and environmental health are also reviewed to reveal the environmental hazards of microplastics. The knowledge gaps and key research priorities of microplastics are identified to better understand and mitigate the environmental risks of microplastics.},

The experiment was designed to maintain minimum soil water content (MSWC) to different levels: 85\%, 70\%, 60\%, 50\%, 40\% of field capacity in rooting depth and treatment to be nonirrigation. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block with four replications, and a non-mulched replication as control. The study indicated plastic mulched had higher ET than non-mulched due to increase of LAI. Seasonal ET was 269 mm for the plastic-mulch treatments with MSWC 40\% and 765 mm with MSWC 85\%, increased 19.8\% and 2\% than non-mulched, respectively. The ET rates of mulch treatments were lower before tillering, and higher after tillering. Plastic mulching could decreased evaporation from soil by 55\% in comparison with non-mulched for the treatment of 60\% MSWC. The yield was the highest with treatment of MSWC 60\% in 1990 and 70\% in 1991, and it was significantly higher than treatments of MSWC 40\% and nonirrigation. However, there were not significant differences in yield when MSWC were between 50\% and 85\%. The water use efficiency (WUE) of the plastic-mulched treatment reduced with the increase in MSWC. They were 0.86 kg m−3 for the treatment of MSWC 85\% in 1990 and 0.89 kg m−3 in 1991, significantly lower than MSWC 40–60\% and nonirrigation. There were increases of 0.9–30.8\% in ET and 4.0–110.3\% in yield for all plastic-mulched treatment over non-mulch. The WUE with plastic mulch was 2–61\% higher than non-mulch, and the difference increased with the decreasing of MSWC. The net seasonal income, benefit–cost ratio and net profit per mm of water used were bigger compared with non-mulched under less than 60\% MSWC, however they became smaller from 60\% up to 85\%. Finally, results revealed that spring wheat mulched with plastic maintained higher WUE and net income than non-mulched under low soil water content, which makes it suitable for deficit irrigation in arid circumstance.},

This study investigated water infiltration and MPs transport and distribution on MP-contaminated silt loam and loamy sand to explore how water flow and MPs affects each other and reveal their mechanisms. The results indicated that water infiltration increased as the content of MP present in the soils increased from 1 to 7\% (w/w), which increased the MP number in deeper soil layers. Besides, for the silt loam sample, the MP concentration first increased to higher levels at 15–20 cm and then decreased. The MPs with sizes of 0–150 μm and 150–500 μm were found in excess at 25–30 cm and 5–20 cm depths, respectively. In the case of the loamy sand sample, the MP concentration gradually increased up to 30 cm depth, and the MPs with sizes of 0–150 μm and 150–500 μm were found in excess at 5–10 cm and 15–30 cm depths, respectively. The increased infiltration was due to the increased hydraulic conductivity resulting from inhibition of soil particle aggregation, increased soil porosity, and strong hydrophobicity of MP particles. The difference in proportions of various MP particle sizes in soil layers was due to the differences in migration ability in pores for various soil samples and MP particle aggregation features.

Microplastics were detected with abundance varies from 0.05 × 105 to 7.58 × 105 items km−2 in the lake surface water, 0.03 × 105 to 0.31 × 105 items km−2 in the inflowing rivers, 50 to 1292 items m−2 in the lakeshore sediment, and 2 to 15 items per individual in the fish samples, respectively. Small microplastics (0.1–0.5 mm) dominated in the lake surface water while large microplastics (1–5 mm) are more abundant in the river samples. Microplastics were predominantly in sheet and fiber shapes in the lake and river water samples but were more diverse in the lakeshore sediment samples. Polymer types of microplastics were mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) as identified using Raman Spectroscopy. Spatially, microplastic abundance was the highest in the central part of the lake, likely due to the transport of lake current. Based on the higher abundance of microplastics near the tourist access points, plastic wastes from tourism are considered as an important source of microplastics in Qinghai Lake. As an important area for wildlife conservation, better waste management practice should be implemented, and waste disposal and recycling infrastructures should be improved for the protection of Qinghai Lake.},

Currently, more than 96 \% of MPs studies are related to marine systems. However, the majority of marine MPs pollution has been confirmed to originate from land-based sources, evidence of MPs in the terrestrial system cannot be overlooked. In this manuscript, up-to-date knowledge regarding the sources and occurrence of MPs from the terrestrial system is comprehensively reviewed. According to the different studies both in China and abroad, microfibers derived from textile washing attributed approximately 35 \% of the MPs identified in the aquatic system. Additionally, personal care and cosmetic products, tires, agricultural plastic films, artificial turfs and road paints, landfill, littering, packaging and construction industry can also release MPs to the environment. The aquatic system plays an important role in MPs transport. By using a one-way ANOVA test, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) accounted for significantly higher percentages than other polymer compositions in surface water. Polyamide (PA) and PP accounted for the majority of polymers in soils. PP, PE, and polystyrene (PS) presented an overwhelming proportion in sediment. Atmospheric deposition presents a new vehicle for entering into the wider environment. More research is urgently required on the topic of exposure risk of atmospheric MPs via inhalation. Morphological characteristics including shapes, sizes, and colors have been discussed among waters, soils, sediments and airborne. These source-occurrence implications continuum summaries can bring us new insights that we cannot underestimate the severity of MPs from land-based sources and should pay more attention to MPs contamination in the terrestrial ecosystem.},

However, the influence of microplastics on the sorption of organic pollutants in soil is unclear. Herein, we investigated the sorption of polar diazepam and nonpolar phenanthrene to two soils (Inceptisol and Oxisol). Batch sorption experiments were used to evaluate the effect of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) microplastics at addition rates of 0.1\%, 1\%, and 10\% (w/w). The addition of microplastics significantly decreased the overall sorption of diazepam at 10\%, and increased the sorption of phenanthrene at 1\%, while the effects were negligible at other addition rates. Decreased sorption of diazepam was attributed to its lower sorption affinity to microplastics than to soil. Microplastics, even at 0.1\%, substantially decreased the relative distribution of phenanthrene in soil, particularly for PE in the Oxisol with lower foc. The sorption affinity of phenanthrene followed the order PE {$>$} soil organic carbon (SOC) {$>$} PP {$>$} PS, suggesting that PE can be a significant sink of phenanthrene in contaminated soils. Overall, microplastics can change the sorption of diazepam and phenanthrene to soil and therefore affect their mobility and environmental risk in soil ecosystems.},

Nitrous oxide emissions from unsaturated rice fields were large and varied considerably during the rice season. They were significantly affected by N fertilizer application rate. In contrast, N2O emission from the waterlogged system was very low with a maximum of 0.28 mg N2O m−2 h−1.

The prepared ferrites were added to flexible poly(vinyl chloride)(PVC) as flame retardants and smoke suppressants. Subsequently, thermal degradation properties of flexible PVC with ferrite additives were investigated by using TGA–DTG, TGA–FTIR, and TGA–MS. The main mechanism underlying the flame-retarding activity was shown to be caused by the catalyzed the dehydrochlorination of PVC at the first stage and breaking of the char residue at higher temperature. The results showed that addition of ferrites, especially MgFe2O4, at the first stage, not only decreased T5\% (defined as the temperature at which 5\% of the initial weight has been lost) and increased the weight loss rate, but also promoted cross-linking and stability of char residue. The main gas pyrolysis products were HCl and benzene. When compared with neat PVC, PVC/MgFe2O4 and PVC/CuFe2O4 generated more HCl and less benzene, and consequently retained more carbon in the matrix with respect to the increased flame-retarding and smoke-suppressing. At the second stage, the weight loss of flame-retarding PVC increased obviously, with simultaneous increase in the yield of main gaseous pyrolysis products, CO2 and aliphatic fragments. PVC/CuFe2O4 generated a high yield of CO2, because of the cationic cracking reactions in the presence of Lewis acid, fragmenting of the char residue at higher temperature. Additionally, the inner surface morphology of the char residue derived from PVC/MgFe2O4 was investigated by SEM and EDS, which showed the existence of alveolate and breakable structures, as well as needle-like structures, composed of a mixture of iron chloride and magnesium chloride.},

In this study, the sorption of tetracycline, a polar and ionizable antibiotic, on three types of microplastics (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS)) were investigated in batch sorption experiments. The sorption isotherms were well fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating that not only hydrophobic interactions but also other interactions (e.g. electrostatic interactions) played important roles in the sorption process. PS had the maximum sorption capacity, following the order PS {$>$} PP {$>$} PE, which can be attributed to polar interactions and π-π interactions. The sorption of tetracycline on microplastics was significantly influenced by pH, with sorption capacity increasing gradually, peaking at pH 6.0 and then decreasing, likely due to the influence of tetracycline speciation with the change of pH. Fulvic acid was selected as representative dissolved organic matter (DOM) to examine the effect on sorption. The increasing concentration of fulvic acid inhibited the sorption of tetracycline on three microplastics, decreasing them by more than 90\% at the fulvic acid concentration of 20 mg/L, which implied a greater affinity of tetracycline to fulvic acid than to microplastics. Increasing salinity from 0.05 to 3.5\% had negligible effects on the sorption of tetracycline on the three microplastics.

  abstract = {Meso- and microplastics (MMPs) have attracted attention as globally dispersed environmental pollutants. However, little is known about the transfers of MMPs between aquatic and terrestrial systems. A large watershed-estuarine area of Bohai Sea was used as a case study, and soils and sediments were sampled adjacent to each other at a wide range of sites. MMPs were detected in all sediments (6.7 to 320 MMPs/kg) and soils (40 to 980 MMPs/kg), with the average abundance in soils double that in sediments on a dry mass basis. MMPs {$<$} 1mm were most abundant and the dominant shape was film in both sediments and soils. Over twenty polymer types were detected and their compositions in sediments and soils were different. MMP abundance in sediments was lower in the upper catchment than the lower catchment, while the abundance of soil MMPs was the opposite. Despite the proximity of the sampling locations, no clear relationship was identified between the soil and sediment MMPs, suggesting low transfer between the two compartments and high heterogeneity of the sources. The missing associations between aquatic and terrestrial MMPs should be systematically examined in future studies, which is crucial for understanding the environmental fate and impacts of MMPs.},

The results showed that although PVC microplastics at 0.1\% and 1\% levels did not have a significant effect on overall bacterial community diversity and composition in soil over the course of 35 days, a number of bacterial genera were significantly reduced or enriched by the presence of microplastics. Potentially due to their effect on certain functional groups, microplastics caused a significant change in soil available P content. It is noteworthy that, depending on soil type, pollution level and plasticizer presence, contrasting effects of microplastics may be observed. Further research is definitely warranted to gain a clearer picture of the threats posed by microplastic pollution in soil environments.},

Although the quantity of MPs present in terrene is much higher than that in aquatic environment, few studies have investigated the chemical behavior of MPs in terrestrial environment. This study investigate the Cu2+ (as a model heavy metal) adsorption capacity of six kinds of MPs (polyamide-6 (PA), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)) in batch adsorption experiments and the effects of different soil environmental factors, including pH and the presence of cations and low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs), as well as ultraviolet (UV) aging. The Cu2+ adsorption capacities of PA and PMMA were higher than those of other MPs and their maximum equilibrium adsorption capacities (estimated by the Langmuir adsorption equation) were 323.6 μg/g ± 38.2 and 41.03 ± 1.78 μg/g, respectively. The Cu2+ adsorption on MPs was affected by pH, and the greatest amount of Cu2+ adsorbed on PA and PMMA was observed at pH = 6 and pH = 7, respectively. The presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ inhibited Cu2+ adsorption by MPs, due to competition for the adsorption sites. Moreover, Cu2+ adsorption by MPs was affected by various types of LMWOAs. The Cu2+ adsorption on PA was significantly reduced by citric acid, followed by oxalic acid, and oxalic acid was particularly evident for Cu2+ adsorption on PMMA. UV aging (200 h) had different effect on Cu2+ adsorption on MPs and it depends on the change of carbonyl index. Results demonstrate that soil environmental factors can change the ability of different MPs to adsorb Cu2+ and affect the transport of pollutants as carriers.},

Pesticide residues and plastic debris, however, have caused serious environmental problems. This study investigated the effects of the commonly used herbicide glyphosate and micrometre-sized plastic debris, referred as microplastics, on glyphosate decay and soil microbial activities in Chinese loess soil by a microcosm experiment over 30 days incubation. Results showed that glyphosate decay was gradual and followed a single first-order decay kinetics model. In different treatments (with/without microplastic addition), glyphosate showed similar half-lives (32.8 days). The soil content of aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the main metabolite of glyphosate, steadily increased without reaching plateau and declining phases throughout the experiment. Soil microbial respiration significantly changed throughout the entirety of the experiment, particularly in the treatments with higher microplastic addition. The dynamics of soil β-glucosidase, urease and phosphatase varied, especially in the treatments with high microplastic addition. Particles that were considerably smaller than the initially added microplastic particles were observed after 30 days incubation. This result thus implied that microplastic would hardly affect glyphosate decay but smaller plastic particles accumulated in soils which potentially threaten soil quality would be further concerned especially in the regions with intensive plastic mulching application.},

  abstract = {Summary Plastic mulches are often used to improve agricultural production by suppressing soil evaporation in the vast arid and semi-arid regions. As a special surface cover, plastic mulch evidently affects the surface albedo and prevents vapour exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, but these physical processes were not contained in the present land surface models. Therefore, simulations remarkably deviate from observations when land surface models are applied to areas with underlying plastic mulch covering. Investigating the effects of various plastic mulches assists in better understanding the atmosphere-land interaction. In this study, a detailed plastic mulch layer model, which considers the effect of plastic mulch on the radiation and heat transfer is constructed and incorporated into a land surface model Two-Big-Leaf-SHAW (TBLSHAW) to simulate the water (H2O), heat and CO2 (carbon dioxide) fluxes in an agro-ecosystem covered by plastic mulch. Data collected by Gulang Heterogeneous Underlying Surface Layer Experiment (GHUSLE) at a plastic mulch-covered cropland site in an arid region were employed to verify the model; simultaneously, the TBLSHAW model was run with the same atmospheric forcing as a comparison to investigate the effect of the plastic mulch. Results suggest that the model can appropriately simulate the water, heat and CO2 fluxes over an arid cropland. The model efficiency is high, and the mean bias error and root mean bias error between the simulated and the observed values are minor. Compared to TBLSHAW simulations, the plastic mulch with special optical properties obviously influenced the surface albedo and radiation balance. By limiting the underside soil evaporation, plastic mulch changes the energy and water transfer between the atmosphere and the land surface. The soil temperature and soil moisture are improved by the transparent plastic mulch, and the plastic mulch not only suppresses the CO2 generated by soil respiration but also affects CO2 budget as a result of the net assimilation controlled by the soil water and heat conditions.},

Polystyrene, one of the commonly used ingredients in paint recipes, is quantified by pyrolysis-GC/MS which offers satisfactory performance with low sample consumption and high sensitivity. Not only are the characteristics of PS during the various pyrolyzing process discussed, but also the matrix effects on quantification are evaluated for better identification of paint sources. We design a method based on the unique pyrolysis characteristics of polystyrene, in which styrene is the major pyrolysis product at nearly 750 °C, to identify and quantify paint samples of different sources with limited quantities and high similarities. Validation of this method is accomplished by joining international proficiency tests twice successfully meeting the requirements, indicating that the method is useful and feasible in examining vehicle paint traces with the convenience and practicability of combining with other analytical techniques for forensic purposes.},

It was an agriculturally oriented region but is becoming an industrialized region. Rural green landscaping in this region possesses characteristics of traditional Chinese gardens. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the visual quality of green landscaping in rural residential areas through public perception-based and expert/design approaches. The former approach enables us to rank green landscaping based on a survey of public preference; the latter weighs the contributions of the attributes contained in a photograph to its overall scenic beauty via correlation, regression, and factor analyses. The photographs used in the survey included road greenways, riparian greenways, residential public gardens and green landscaping around houses, with each type of landscape represented by seven photographs. In total, 141 college students and 41 other participants ranked photographs of each landscaping type from highest to lowest preference. The results indicate that the preferences of students are similar to those of the general public. Examples of green landscaping depicted in the “best” four photographs possessed more attractive qualities regarding the variety of vegetation, richness of colors and a selection of human additions compared to those depicted in the “worst” photographs. The perceived visual quality was positively influenced by, in decreasing order of importance, the variety of vegetation, color contrast, the openness of green spaces, the area of vegetation, and positive man-made elements; conversely, it was negatively influenced by the type of topography. Moreover, some suggestions were offered for future rural greening regarding perceived visual beauty.},

Paraquat and Mancozeb when applied to unstabilized clear polyethylene film, followed by exposure to UV radiation, resulted in direct attack of the polymer, evident by faster rates of oxidation and shorter times to embrittlement compared to a polyethylene control. Reapplication of these chemicals during exposure, as often occurs in agricultural practice, resulted in even faster degradation. In contrast, Sulfur and Chlorpyrifos did not have a significant effect on the photodegradation of exposed unstabilized polyethylene film. When the polyethylene film was pigmented (white top layer containing rutile titanium dioxide and carbon black in the bottom layer) and stabilized with the addition of hindered amine stabilizers (HAS), differences in oxidation susceptibility were seen with repeated exposure to Paraquat showing the most dramatic effect. This was evident by an increased carbonyl index, decrease in elongation at break and an increase in tensile stress at yield compared to a control film and other agrichemical treatments. These studies enable degradation from accelerated consumption of stabilizers by the agrichemicals (and their degradation products) to be differentiated from enhanced photochemical initiation of the polyethylene degradation.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of three MPs (membranous polyethylene (PE), fibrous polypropylene (PP), and microsphere PP) on enzyme activities and microbial community structure in one loamy and sandy soil. The concentration of microsphere PP (2 mg/g) was one-tenth of those of the other two MPs (20 mg/g). The results showed that the effects of three MPs on urease, dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase activities followed the order: fibrous PP {$>$} membranous PE {$>$} microsphere PP, membranous PE {$>$} microsphere PP {$>$} fibrous PP and fibrous PP {$>$} microsphere PP {$>$} membranous PE, respectively. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the membranous PE and fibrous PP raised the alpha diversities of the soil microbiota, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on MPs surfaces were significantly lower than those in the amended soils. MPs significantly altered the microbial community structure, especially for the enrichment of Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes, the depletion of Deinococcus-Thermus and Chloroflexi. Aeromicrobium, Streptomyces, Mycobacterium, Janibacter, Nocardia, Arthrobacter were prone to inhabit on the MPs surfaces. Practitioner points Three microplastics had different effects on soil enzyme activities. Fibrous PP had a more persistent effect on microbial activity. Membranous PE and fibrous PP raised the alpha diversities of soil microbiota. The effects of membranous PE and fibrous PP on microbial communities were similar.

  abstract = {Once believed to degrade into simple compounds, increasing evidence suggests plastics entering the environment are mechanically, photochemically, and/or biologically degraded to the extent that they become imperceptible to the naked eye yet are not significantly reduced in total mass. Thus, more and smaller plastics particles, termed microplastics, reside in the environment and are now a contaminant category of concern. The current study tested the hypotheses that microplastics concentration would be higher in proximity to urban sources, and vary temporally in response to weather phenomena such as storm events. Triplicate surface water samples were collected approximately monthly between July and December 2011 from four estuarine tributaries within the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. using a manta net to capture appropriately sized microplastics (operationally defined as 0.3-5.0 mm). Selected sites have watersheds with broadly divergent land use characteristics (e.g., proportion urban/suburban, agricultural and/or forested) and wide ranging population densities. Microplastics were found in all but one of 60 samples, with concentrations ranging over 3 orders of magnitude ({$<$}1.0 to {$>$}560 g/km(2)). Concentrations demonstrated statistically significant positive correlations with population density and proportion of urban/suburban development within watersheds. The greatest microplastics concentrations also occurred at three of four sites shortly after major rain events.},

  abstract = {The availability of soil phosphorus was studied in response to the forage production of seeded alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), established by the ridge and furrow water-harvesting technique in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. The following 5 treatments were set up in this study: (1) conventional cultivation in a flat plot without mulch (CK); (2) plastic mulched ridge with 30 cm width of ridge and furrow (M30); (3) plastic mulched ridge with 60 cm width of ridge and furrow (M60); (4) bare ridge with 30 cm width of ridge and furrow (B30); (5) bare ridge with 60 cm width of ridge and furrow (B60). The forage yield, evapotranspiration (ET), soil organic carbon (SOC), total phosphorus, available phosphorus and the ratio of soil organic C to available P (C/P) were measured in the experiment. Results showed that the positive correlation occurred between the decrease in soil available P and the total forage yield of alfalfa after three-year alfalfa stand. M30 and M60 were higher than those of conventional flat cultivation (CK) by 10.7\% and 40.3\%, respectively, whereas the yield of two bare treatments (B30 and B60) was lower than that of CK by 14.2\% and 28.3\%, respectively. After a 3-year alfalfa stand, the trend of the decrease in soil available P was in the order of M60 (55.5\%) \&gt; M30 (51.5\%) \&gt; CK (34.6\%) \&gt; B30 (23.4\%) \&gt; B60 (17.5\%). Moreover, after 3-year alfalfa growth, the C/P ratio increased significantly in all of the treatments by comparing with that before sowing. The C/P ratios of M30 (1165.1) and M60 (1326.1) were significantly higher than those of the other treatments. More interesting finding was that the increase in SOC in dry years promoted the accumulation of soil available P. However, in wet years, the increase of SOC limited the accumulation of soil available P. Therefore, to further increase the forage yield of alfalfa, the effective technique must be developed to increase the soil available P.},

  abstract = {The impacts of microplastics on aquatic ecosystems and biota are gaining attention globally. Although microplastics have been widely detected in biota, there currently are few standardized detection and identification methods. The present study developed a novel one-step digestion method which was evaluated with mussel and fish samples. This method employed nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide (HNO3:H2O2 = 4:1 by volume) as digestion reagents, which completely digested biota samples {$<$}5 g weight within 30 min at 50 °C. A density separation step was subsequently used to remove organic residues as necessary. The efficiency and suitability of this method were tested by spiking microplastics of 7 different types and of various sizes (1000, 900, 675, 300, 250, and 150 μm) into mussel and gastrointestinal tracts of fish. The recoveries of microplastics ranged from 90 to 100\%. No significant changes in weight, surface area, and particle size (t test, p {$>$} 0.05) were observed for all tested polymers. Fourier transform infrared spectral analyses demonstrated that the method did not degrade any of the polymers except for polyethylene terephthalate. The method was demonstrated with mussel and fish samples collected from the Pearl River delta, south China, and was able to recover microplastics effectively. Overall, the present method is time-saving and easy to operate, with low procedural cross-contamination. The properties of microplastics recovered by the present method remained largely intact, greatly benefiting subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Plastic mulching is suspected to be a significant source of microplastics in terrestrial environments. Straw incorporation has many effects on the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas emissions, but these effects have not been studied in the presence of microplastic pollution. In this study, 365-day soil incubation experiments were conducted to assess the effects of maize straw and polyethylene microplastics on SOC fractions and carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in two different soils (fluvo-aquic and latosol). Against the background of straw incorporation, microplastics reduced the mineralization and decomposition of SOC, resulting in a microbially available SOC content decrease by 18.9\%. In addition, microplastics were carbon-rich, but relatively stable and difficult to be used by microorganisms, thus increasing the mineral-associated SOC content by 52.5\%. This indicated that microplastics had adverse effects on microbially available SOC and positive effects on mineral-associated SOC. Microplastics also decreased coarse particulate SOC ({$>$}250~μm), and increased non-aggregated silt and clay aggregated SOC ({$<$}53~μm). Furthermore, microplastics changed microbial community compositions, thereby reducing the CO2 and N2O emissions of straw incorporation by 26.5\%–33.9\% and 35.4\%–39.7\%, respectively. These results showed that microplastics partially offset the increase of CO2 and N2O emissions induced by straw incorporation. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of microplastics on CO2 emissions in fluvo-aquic soil was lower than that in latosol soil, whereas the inhibitory effect on N2O emissions had the opposite trend.},

The factors affecting the pretreatment procedures, such as the solvents, the extraction sorbents and the extraction process had limited influences compared with matrix effects. Using such boundary model, we found that selecting suitable qualitative and quantitative ions for MS detector is more important for reducing the matrix effect in GC-MS analysis than the traditionally used methods of optimizing the pretreatment process since some clean up sorbents might be useless to reduce the matrix effects. As for 2,2′,4,4′,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99), the fragmental ions were usually used for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which however was easily affected by the matrix effects. While, molecular ions would eliminate the influences from the sample matrix. Such a model could be used to decrease the uncertainty and increase the accuracy of environmental trace analysis.},

Here, we numerically simulated how to take representative terrestrial samples to quantify plastic particles, and we evaluated the accuracy (error) of reported plastic concentrations in the literature. Fields with randomly distributed plastic particles (uniform and clustered) were numerically generated and sampled to determine the representative elementary volume (REV) and the required number of samples to quantify plastic concentrations (10 to 106 particles/m2) with different relative errors (5\%, 10\%, 15\%). The REV and the required number of samples decrease hyperbolically as the plastic concentration increases, indicating a strong non-linear relation. For instance, hundreds to thousands of soil cores (8-cm diameter) would be required to quantify plastics at low concentrations (102 particles/m2), while a few cores are sufficient at high plastic concentrations (105 particles/m2). For an accurate measurement of plastic concentrations, the total surface area of samples taken should approach or exceed the REV. We recommend to take replicated samples with each sample as large as possible (e.g., 1 m × 1 m) rather than multiple small cores, and then reduce the soil volume by the quartering method.},

  abstract = {Environmental context Microplastics found in soil pose several potential environmental risks. This study shows that microplastics on the soil surface can be ingested by earthworms and transported to the lower soil layers. In this way, microplastics may enter the food chain and find their way into groundwater systems, especially in cases where the water table is shallow. Abstract In the current study, we examine how the activities of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) affect microplastic (MP) distribution and concentration in soil, with a focus on low density polyethylene (LDPE). We also want to determine if MPs can be flushed out with water. We used a laboratory sandy soil column (polyvinyl chloride tube) experimental set-up and tested five different treatments: (1) treatment with just soil (control) to check if the saturated conductivity (Ksat) could be impacted by MP, (2) treatment with MP, (3) treatment with MP and litter, (4) treatment with earthworms and litter as a second control for treatment 5 and (5) treatment with MPs, earthworms and litter. Each treatment consisted of eight replicates. For the treatments with MP, the concentration of MP added at the start of the experiment was 7 \% by weight (3.97 g, polyethylene, 50 \% 1 mm–250 µm, 30 \% 250 µm–150 µm and 20 \% {$<$}150 µm) based on 52.78 g of dry litter from Populus nigra. In the treatments using earthworms, two adult earthworms, with an initial average weight of (7.14 ± 0.26) g, were placed in each column. Results showed that LDPE particles could be introduced into the soil by the earthworms. MP particles were detected in each soil sample and within different soil layers for the earthworm treatments. Earthworms showed a tendency to transport the smaller MP particles and that the amount of MPs in size class {$<$}250 μm increased in soil samples with increasing soil depth in comparison to the other size classes. After leaching, MPs were only detected in the leachate from the treatments with the earthworms, and the MP had similar size distributions as the soil samples in the 40–50 cm layer of the treatment with MP, earthworms and litter. The results of this study clearly show that biogenic activities can mobilise MP transport from the surface into the soil and even be leached into drainage. It is highly likely that biogenic activities constitute a potential pathway for MPs to be transported into soil and groundwater.},

It is important to study microplastics effects on soil microorganisms to better understand their effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, we collected soil and microplastic samples from corn, pepper, peanut and cucumber fields in Shunyi District, Beijing, China, and used Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity. We focused on microplastic surface and its surrounding “rhizosphere-like” soil in the 0–10 cm (humus) and 10–20 cm (eluvial) deep horizons. Microbial richness and diversity on microplastic surface were significantly lower than those in surrounding “rhizosphere-like” soil, and microbial richness and diversity were reduced to a greater extent in the humus horizon than in the eluvial horizon. Microplastics likely enriched the microbes involved in their biodegradation. The relative abundance levels of Cyanobacteria and Basidiomycota on microplastic surfaces were significantly higher than those in surrounding “rhizosphere-like” soil, while the relative abundance levels of Acidobacteria, Chloreflexi, and Mortierellomycota were higher in “rhizosphere-like” soil. Furthermore, the relative abundance levels of pathways related to human diseases, animal pathogen, and fungal parasites were significantly higher on microplastic surfaces than in “rhizosphere-like” soil. These results show that the microbial diversity, richness, community structure and function between microplastic surfaces and surrounding “rhizosphere-like” soil are significantly different, leading to a “rhizosphere-like neighbor avoidance effect” between microplastic surfaces and the surrounding soil.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are observed ubiquitously and in different environmental compartments ranging from marine waters and sediments to freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems including biota. Over the last decade, several methods have been applied and advanced to monitor and quantify microplastics, to identify the polymer material and to describe the particle properties, such as size, shape or colour. In most cases, the overarching aim is to elucidate patterns of occurrence that might result from (micro)plastic emissions and environmental fate. But the applied methods are subject to uncertainties and boundary conditions, be it spatial resolution that excludes the smallest microplastics or limitations in distinguishing microplastic particles from natural particles. This critical review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art procedures in microplastic analysis, gives examples of potential ways ahead and remaining challenges and classifies available methods according to the underlying research question. The resulting decision tree for the selection of analytical methods starts with a common research question and takes specificities of the environmental matrix into account. The procedural range consequently ranges from fast screening methods based on visual identification to a highly sophisticated combination of analytical methods that provide information on polymer type, particle number or mass and eventually particle size but are very time-consuming and expensive. Standardization of microplastic analytical methods on the basis of the research aim will help to make study results comparable and obtain a more comprehensive picture of microplastic abundance and fate in the environment.},

For the determination of soil microbial biomass a good correlation was obtained between the total amount of PLFAs and the microbial biomass measured with methods commonly used for determinations such as total adenylate content and substrate-induced respiration. Generally, after the application of multivariate statistical analyses, whole-community fatty acid profiles indicate which communities are similar or different. However, in most cases, the organisms accounting for similarity or difference cannot be determined, and therefore artefacts could not be excluded. The fatty acids used to determine the biomass vary from those which determine the community structure. Specific attention has to be paid when choosing extraction methods in order to avoid the liberation of fatty acids from non-living organic material and deposits, and to exclude the non-target selection of lipids from living organisms, as well. By excluding the fatty acids which were presumed to be common and widespread prior to multivariate statistical analysis, estimates were improved considerably. Results from principal component analysis showed that determining the levels of fatty acids present in both low and high concentrations is essential in order to correctly identify microorganisms and accurately classify them into taxonomically defined groups. The PLFA technique has been used to elucidate different strategies employed by microorganisms to adapt to changed environmental conditions under wide ranges of soil types, management practices, climatic origins and different perturbations. It has been proposed that the classification of PLFAs into a number of chemically different subgroups should simplify the evaluating procedure and improve the assessment of soil microbial communities, since then only the subgroups assumed to be involved in key processes would be investigated.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) have attracted significant concern due to their persistence and adverse effects on organisms. In this review, we summarize the recent literature on the natural and artificial aging process of MPs, and also discuss the associated aging characteristics and mechanisms of MPs. The aged MPs show different morphological and chemical properties from the pristine MPs. Furthermore, to evaluate associated aging effects, the corresponding release of aging process of MPs were systematically evaluated, including the additives and intermediates. Different types of organic pollutants and heavy metals additives are listed. In addition, the release of MPs is affected by environmental factors (i.e., Illumination, salinity, temperature and pH). Aged MPs are more easily absorbed by organisms and have different toxic effects from the pristine MPs. The potential risks of aging MPs and the release of MPs during aging are discussed in detail. This overview provides a direction for further study on the behavior and the toxic effects of MPs in the environment.},

The abundances of microplastics were from 3407.7 x 10(3) to 13,617.5 x 10(3) items per square kilometer in the main stream of the Yangtze River and from 192.5 x 10(3) to 11,889.7 x 10(3) items per square kilometer in the estuarine areas of four tributaries. The abundance of microplastics in the main stream of the Yangtze River generally increased as moving closer to the Three Gorges Dam. The microplastics are made exclusively of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). Together with microplastics, high abundance of coal/fly ash was also observed in the surface water samples. Comparing with previously reported data, microplastics in the TGR were approximately one to three orders of magnitudes greater, suggesting reservoirs as potential hot spot for microplastic pollution.

Phthalates (phthalic acid esters, PAEs), an important additive of agricultural films, can be released and contaminate the environment. Here, we analyzed the agricultural plastic usage and assessed plastic debris in China and developed a method to estimate PAE emissions from agricultural films. Additionally, the environmental fate of PAEs was evaluated using a fugacity-based multimedia model. The agricultural plastic film usage in China in 2017 was 2,528,600 tons. After agricultural film recycling and water erosion, the plastic debris amount was estimated as 465,016 tons. The water erosion process carried 4329 tons of plastic debris into the aquatic environment. During its lifetime, the agricultural film released a total of 91.5 tons of two typical types of PAEs. PAEs from the mulching film would mostly be removed through degradation, while those from the greenhouse film accumulate in vegetables. Populated regions exhibited more serious PAE pollution in vegetables but with no immediate health risks. The model was well evaluated using comparable measured concentrations and uncertainty analysis based on the Monte Carlo method. The findings from this study demonstrate the serious agricultural plastic pollution problem and associated PAE contamination in China.},

  abstract = {Aspen lignin extracted by an organosolv process was pyrolyzed in the presence of catalysts and analyzed using Py-GC/MS. The pyrolysis products detected are mostly aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds. The lignin and catalysts were either mixed or arranged in layers. Two different micro-porous zeolite catalysts, HZSM-5 and HY, were compared in the study. The effects of the catalysts on the production of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds were assessed quantitatively. The HZSM-5 catalyst was found to produce from 2.5 to 40 times more aromatic hydrocarbons than the HY catalyst, by converting phenolic compounds into aromatic hydrocarbons. For the HZSM-5 catalyst, the effects of placement of catalyst were not as pronounced as were for HY. The data suggest that for any catalyst type and placement there exists an optimum catalyst-to-lignin ratio that maximizes the total production of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds. For HZSM-5 in the mixture arrangement, a catalyst-to-lignin ratio of 3:1 was found to maximize both the aromatic hydrocarbons and the aggregate sum of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolic compounds. At this ratio, 23\% yield of aromatic hydrocarbons and 28\% yield of the aggregate sum were obtained. Also at these conditions, the products detected are estimated to have a total oxygen content of about 4\% and higher heating value of 46MJ/kg, roughly the same as gasoline and diesel. Toluene and p-xylene were the two most abundant hydrocarbons formed in the presence of catalysts. Up to 6.6\% and 6.3\% of the original lignin were converted into toluene and p-xylene, respectively. We estimate that if all the lignin produced in pulp and paper mills was catalytically pyrolyzed, the amount of toluene produced would be more than 30\% of the current annual production of toluene from fossil sources worldwide.},

The rate of DBP exceeding soil remediation standard was 12.9~\%. Overall, concentrations of PAEs in Beijing were at a high level in China. The concentrations of DBP, DEHP, and DIBP were high, and the total concentrations of all the phthalate esters were higher in the areas with intensive human activities than in the other areas, which may be related to the use of phthalate compounds (such as the use of plastic products). The total and individual concentrations of phthalate compounds were relatively low in the areas that used plastic films compared with other samples due to the diffusion of atmospheric motion, categories, and amounts of plastic products and other factors. The greatest contributor may be the usage amount of plastic products in people’s daily lives.},

This study focused on yellow-brown paddy soil and the particle-size fractions of {$>$}2000, 2000-200, 200-63, 63-2 and 2-0.1 mu m. Microplate fluorometric assays and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) were used to determine soil biological characteristics under no fertilizer (control, CK), fertilizer N (N), fertilizer N and P (NP), fertilizer N, P and K (NPK), organic manure plus fertilizer N, P and K (NPKM) and organic manure (M) treatments. The results showed that fertilizer and soil fraction individually and interactively (P {$<$} 0.05) affected soil C, N contents, enzyme activities and microbial communities except for alpha-glucosidase activity, bacterial relative abundance and the G+: G-ratio. Particularly, organic treatments significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) contents of all five fractions. The highest C and N contents and enzyme activities were observed in the 200-63 mu m fraction, except for phosphatase and sulfatase, which showed the highest activities in the 2-0.1 mu m fraction. The highest activities of beta-glucosidase, beta-cellobiosidase, alpha-glucosidase, aminopeptidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase in each fraction were obtained in the organic treatments (NPKM and M). Activities of phosphatase, sulfatase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and beta-xylosidase in the 2000-200 mu m fraction were highest under NPK treatment. PLFA analysis showed that the {$>$} 63 mu m fraction contained higher abundance of total PLFAs than that in the 63-0.1 mu m fraction. Organic treatments significantly enhanced total PLFAs abundance in {$>$} 2000 mu m fraction, but decreased PLFAs abundance in the 2000-200 mu m fraction compared with the NPK treatment. Larger fractions ({$>$} 2000 mu m and 2000-200 mu m) held relatively lower G+: G-ratios and higher fungi: bacteria ratios, which indicated better soil conditions in these fractions. Principal component analysis showed a smaller variability of microbial community composition among treatments than particle-size fractions. Most treatments of larger fractions ({$>$} 2000 mu m and 2000-2 mu m) were well separated from the other fractions. Redundancy analysis showed total N, C: N ratio, phosphatase, sulfatase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and beta-cellobiosidase activities significantly affected the composition of the microbial community. Significant correlations were also obtained between enzyme activities with SOC, total N and C: N ratio. We concluded that the long-term application of organic fertilizers contributed to improvements in the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen and most of the enzyme activities, especially for the 200-63 mu m fraction, along with abundant and diverse microbial community composition in larger particles.

  abstract = {Plastic particle accumulation in arable soils is a growing contaminant of concern with unknown consequences for soil productivity and quality. This study aimed to investigate abundance and distribution of plastic particles among soil aggregate fractions in four cropped areas and an established riparian forest buffer zone at Dian Lake, southwestern China. Plastic particles (10–0.05 mm) from fifty soil samples were extracted and then sorted by size, counted, and categorized. Plastic particles were found in all soil samples. The concentration of plastic particles ranges from 7100 to 42,960 particles kg−1 (mean 18,760 particles kg−1). 95\% of the sampled plastic particles are in the microplastic size (1–0.05 mm) range. The predominant form is plastic fibers, making up on average 92\% of each sample followed by fragments and films that contributed with to 8\%. Results of this study also show that 72\% of plastic particles are associated with soil aggregates, and 28\% of plastic particles are dispersed. The abundance of aggregate-associated plastic fibers is significantly greater in the micro-aggregate than that in the macro-aggregate, whereas the less concentrations of plastic films and fragments are found in the micro-aggregate. Compared to the adjacent vegetable soil, the less concentration of plastic particles in the buffer soil implicates that application of soil amendments and irrigation with wastewater must be controlled to reduce accumulation of microplastics in agricultural soils. While the implications of microplastic on ecological and human health are poorly understood, the staggering number of microplastic in agricultural soils should be continually concerned in the future.},

Low-density plastic has been widely used in farmlands, but the factors that influence Low-density microplastic (LDMP) distribution are still not clear. In this study, both field investigations at small and large scales and laboratory simulations, and both geostatistics and classical statistics were used to examine LDMP distributions and the main driving factors in farmland soils. The results showed the following. (1) Only polyethylene (PE) of LDMP was found in farmland. (2) The means of LDMP weight content (LDMP-W), LDMP abundance (LDMP-AB) and LDMP area content (LDMP-A) were 0.27~mg~kg−1, 107~N~kg−1 and 12.6~mm2~kg−1 in mollisol farmlands, respectively. (3) LDMPs were positively correlated with macroplastics (MAP) at the large scale, while any correlations were not obvious at small scales. (4) LDMPs were not only transported by surface soil–water loss ({$>$}96\%) but were also transported by infiltration through soil pores ({$<$}4\%). (5). LDMP loss increased with soil bulk density (BD) increasing, and low BD tends to increase LDMP loss by interflow. (6) LDMP distribution was not only influenced by water movement but also maybe influenced by microorganisms and crops. For LDMP pollution control, the focus on both surface soil–water loss and the infiltration processes is necessary, and a combination of the functions of microorganisms and crops probably accelerate LDMP decomposition in soils.},

  abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems are actively managed by humans to optimize the provision of food, fiber, and fuel. These ecosystem services from agriculture, classified as provisioning services by the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, depend in turn upon a web of supporting and regulating services as inputs to production (e.g., soil fertility and pollination). Agriculture also receives ecosystem dis-services that reduce productivity or increase production costs (e.g., herbivory and competition for water and nutrients by undesired species). The flows of these services and dis-services directly depend on how agricultural ecosystems are managed and upon the diversity, composition, and functioning of remaining natural ecosystems in the landscape. Managing agricultural landscapes to provide sufficient supporting and regulating ecosystem services and fewer dis-services will require research that is policy-relevant, multidisciplinary and collaborative. This paper focuses on how ecosystem services contribute to agricultural productivity and how ecosystem dis-services detract from it. We first describe the major services and dis-services as well as their key mediators. We then explore the importance of scale and economic externalities for the management of ecosystem service provision to agriculture. Finally, we discuss outstanding issues in regard to improving the management of ecosystem services and dis-services to agriculture.},

A better understanding of tillage and surface cover management on surface soil structure is vital for the development of effective soil conservation practices in the long term. Changes in surface soil structure and hydraulic properties were measured after 4 years of straw and plastic film management under contrasting tillage practices (no tillage vs. conventional tillage) in a silt loam soil (Los Orthic Entisol) which had been under conventional management for hundred of years in the northwestern Loess Plateau, China. Surface soil (0–10 cm) under no tillage with straw cover had the highest water stability of macro-aggregates (\&gt;250 μm) and the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity. Compared with straw cover, plastic film cover did not change macro-aggregate stability and the soil had the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) but the highest \% \&lt;50 μm soil particles. Significant correlation was found between water stable macro-aggregates and soil organic carbon content, indication the importance of the latter on soil structural development. No tillage on its own (without straw cover) was not sufficient to improve structural stability probably due to lack of organic carbon input. While use of plastic film cover might lead to short term yield increases, results indicated that it did little to improve soil physical fertility. On the other hand, no tillage with straw cover management should lead to long-term improvement of physical quality of this structurally fragile soil.},

In this area, plastic film mulching is one of the important measures to increase the crop yield. Using an in situ soil N mineralization device, this paper explored the situation of soil N mineralization and mineral N leaching under different durations of plastic film mulching. This work was carried out on the widespread sandy loam of this area with conventional peanut (Arachis hypogaea) cultivation. The field experiment contained a non-mulched treatment (M0) and four mulching time treatments from sowing to the end of peanut seedling stage (M1), flowering stage (M2), pod setting stage (M3) and pod filling stage (M4). Results showed that mulching increased the soil temperature at the seedling stage and soil water content during the whole growing season. In general, the total N mineralization and soil mineral N content increased with the increase of mulching duration. The largest N mineralization was observed in the M4 treatment with 139.7 mg kg−1, and the lowest was measured in the M1 treatment with 32.3 mg kg−1. Mineral N content in the M0, M1, M2 and M3 treatments were 29.7\%, 34.9\%, 31.6\% and 8.4\% less than in the M4 treatment, respectively. On the other hand, the lowest cumulative mineral N leached was measured in the M4 treatment with 14.0 mg kg−1; secondly was the M3 treatment with 14.3 mg kg−1 and the highest cumulative mineral N leached was 16.3 mg kg−1 in the M1 treatment. The highest pod and haulm yield, 1588 kg ha−1 and 1963 kg ha−1, respectively, were recorded in the M3 treatment. This study indicated that plastic film mulching from peanut sowing to the end of the pod setting stage (M3 treatment) resulted in higher N mineralization, less mineral N leaching and the highest peanut yield, and it can be widely used in peanut planting in the Yimeng Mountainous Area.},

  abstract = {Plastic mulch is widely used for vegetable cropping in the mid-Yunnan plateau, southwestern China. However, the effects of plastic mulch on soil physical properties are poorly understood. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different plastic mulch patterns (narrow and wide plastic mulch) and rotations (broccoli–zucchini–winter wheat and broccoli–zucchini–fallow) on soil physical properties and soil organic carbon content in a vegetable production system at a research station in the region. The experiment comprised four treatments and laid out in the field using randomized complete block design replicated nine times. The soil (0–20 cm) under wide plastic mulch retained more water than the soil narrow plastic mulch under the vegetable growing season over 3 consecutive severe drought years. Significant decline (11\%) of surface soil (0–5 cm) organic carbon was observed in 2012 compared with in 2010, but soil organic carbon and physical properties did not differ significantly between the two different plastic mulch patterns. The higher macro-porosity, aggregate stability, Ksat and lower bulk density in the plastic mulched ridges imply that the conversion from narrow-plastic-mulch to wide-plastic-mulch increases mulched area thereby conserving larger area soil structure in the croplands. Although increased catch crop stubble retention in the furrows apparently improved surface soil macro-porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the autumn rotary cultivation in broccoli–zucchini–winter wheat rotation system has significantly decreased (5\%) surface soil organic carbon. The results suggested that continued use of vegetable–cereal crop rotation system, even with stubble retention, may result in loss soil organic carbon. Further research that covers wetter years should be taken to assess effects of vegetable–cereal crop rotation pattern on soil physical properties in this region.},

  abstract = {Microplastic polystyrene foam has been found widely in the environment and is readily transported by wind or water. Beached and virgin foams of size 0.45–1 mm were prepared as sorbents to study oxytetracycline sorption. Enhanced adsorption were found in the beached foams compared to the virgin foams, corresponding to the higher specific surface area, micropore area and the degree of oxidation of the former. The Freundlich Kf value was 894 ± 84 ((mg kg−1) (mg L−1)1/n) for oxytetracycline adsorption on the beached foams, approximately twice as high as on the virgin foams. Effects of solution pH on adsorption to the beached foams were more pronounced to the virgin foams. Maximum adsorption occurred at pH 5 at which electrostatic repulsion between the microplastic surface and the oxytetracycline zwitterion was minimal, indicating that electrostatic interaction may have regulated adsorption. Moreover, H-bonding and multivalent cationic bridging mechanisms may also have affected the adsorption of oxytetracycline to the beached foams as reflected by the ionic effects. Adsorption was promoted more in the presence of humic acid than of fulvic acid, perhaps owing to π-π conjugation between the humic acid and the microplastic surface which led to enhanced electrostatic attraction for oxytetracycline. This study suggests that weathered polystyrene foams may act as carriers of antibiotics in the environment and their potential risks to ecosystem and human health merit further investigation.},

The effects of temperature, co-feeding ratios, feed-to-catalyst ratios and dual catalysts on hydrocarbon yields and selectivities were investigated. The results show a general improvement in the aromatic hydrocarbons yields in all cases compared to non-catalytic and pure biomass pyrolysis. The aromatic hydrocarbons increased by 10 fold with the increase of temperature from 400°C to 700°C. The aromatic yields increased 1.5 times at co-feeding, 2.0 greater at feed/HZSM-5 ratio of 1:6, 1.2 times at feed/USY ratio of 1:16, and 2.66 times at USY/HZSM-5 scenario. The selectivities towards benzene increased, at higher co-feeding ratios, while that of toluene shows an opposite trend. Xylenes selectivities were less sensitive to the changes of co-feeding ratios. In contrast, the USY catalyst only produced little amount of toluene and xylenes. The dual catalyst design (USY/HZSM-5) resulted in the highest aromatic yields, than other catalyst design scenarios. The pyrolysis temperature is a significant parameter for hydrocarbon production. Co-feeding bagasse and bio-plastic enhanced biomass conversion to aromatic compounds. For any type of zeolite catalyst, there was an optimum feed-to-catalyst ratio that generated maximum hydrocarbons. Dual catalyst layout shows a new opportunity for efficient conversion of biomass materials into hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {Plastic film mulching is widely employed to improve crop yields. Mulching for the entire crop growth period is a widespread practice. However, a shorter plastic film mulching duration is suggested for obtaining larger grain yield recently. To quantify the effects of plastic film mulching durations on soil erosion and nutrient losses, a three-treatment experiment with three replicates was constructed in field. The designed treatments were control (M0, non-mulched treatment), mulching from sowing to the end of the peanut pod-setting stage (M1) and pod-filling stage (M2). Plastic film mulching significantly increased the mean runoff and sediment yield. With film mulching, the mean runoff and soil losses among M1 and M2 treatments had no significant difference, and significantly larger than that in M0 treatment. After mulching removing, there were no significant differences between the mean runoff and soil losses of M0 and M1 treatments. Compared with the M2 treatment, the M0 treatment had significantly reduced mean runoff and soil losses of all the events. Non-mulching increased the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) losses. The M0 treatment had the highest TN (23.0 mg m−2) and TP (3.02 mg m−2) losses in the three treatments. The M2 treatment significantly reduced the TN and TP losses. In conclusion, mulching from sowing to the end of pod-setting stage was suggested as the appropriate choice for the largest yield and less soil erosion. But, some soil conservation measurements should be taken in furrow areas to effectively reduce soil erosion, under the condition of film mulching.},

Here we studied the interaction of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) with polyethylene and biodegradable plastic mulches. The objective was to assess whether earthworms would select between different types of mulches when foraging for food, and whether they drag macroscopic plastic mulch into the soil. Laboratory experiments were carried out with earthworms in Petri dishes and mesocosms. The treatments were standard polyethylene mulch, four biodegradable plastic mulches (PLA/PHA [polylactic acid/polyhydroxy alkanoate], Organix, BioAgri, Naturecycle), a biodegradable paper mulch (WeedGuardPlus), and poplar litter, which served as control. Four and three replicates for the Petri dish and mesocosm experiments were used, respectively. Macroscopic plastic and paper mulch pieces (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm and 2 cm × 2 cm) were collected from an agricultural field after a growing season, after being buried in the soil for 6 and 12 months, and after being composted for 2 weeks. We found that earthworms did not ingest polyethylene. Field-weathered biodegradable plastic mulches were not ingested either, however, after soil burial and composting, some biodegradable plastics were eaten and could not be recovered from soil any longer. Earthworms, when foraging for food, dragged plastic mulch, including polyethylene and biodegradable plastic, and poplar leaves into their burrows. The burial of macroscopic plastic mulch underground led to a redistribution of plastics in the soil profile, and likely enhances the degradation of biodegradable mulches in soil, but also can lead to leaching of plastic fragments by macropore flow.},

Tibetan Plateau possesses the greatest numbers of high-altitude inland lakes in the world. However, no information is currently available on the characteristic of microplastic pollution in those lakes within this remote area. In this work, lakeshore sediments from four lakes within the Siling Co basin in northern Tibet were sampled and examined for microplastics ({$<$}5~mm). Microplastics were detected in six out of seven sampling sites with abundances ranging from 8~±~14 to 563~±~1219~items/m2. Riverine input might have contributed to the high abundance of microplastics observed in this remote area. Morphological features suggest that microplastics are derived from the breakdown of daily used plastic products. Polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl chloride were identified from the microplastic samples using laser Raman spectroscopy, and oxidative and mechanical weathering textures were observed on the surface of microplastics using scanning electron microscope. These results demonstrate the presence of microplastics even for inland lakes in remote areas under very low human impact, and microplastic pollution can be a global issue.},

However, little is known about the effects of microplastics on agroecosystems, particularly for soil microbial communities. Herein, microplastics collected from cotton fields in Xinjiang, China, were analysed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-throughput sequencing to investigate the attached bacterial communities. Microplastic surfaces, especially pits and flakes, were colonized by various microorganisms, suggesting active hydrolysis of plastic debris. The bacterial communities colonizing microplastics were significantly different in structure from those in the surrounding soil, plant litter and macroplastics. In addition, statistical analysis of differentially abundant OTUs showed that microplastics serve as a “special microbial accumulator” in farmland soil, enriching some taxa that degrade polyethylene, such as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the biotic interactions between microorganisms on microplastics are as complex as those in soil, and Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes are considered keystone species in bacterial communities. Collectively, the findings imply that microplastics acted as a distinct habitat for bacteria in farmland soil, which increases our understanding of microplastic pollution.},

Both Cd adsorption and desorption in soils with or without MPs reached equilibrium within 120 min. Cd adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second order model, and the adsorption isotherm fitted to the Langmuir model more precisely than the Freundlich model. Overall, addition of MPs decreased Cd adsorption but increased desorption, and the effects varied with MPs dose and particle size, and solution pH. MPs-induced decrease in Cd adsorption and increase in Cd desorption were more pronounced at higher MPs dose and larger particle size, but varied differently from solution pH. EDS analysis confirmed Cd adsorption on MPs surface. Both MPs before and after Cd adsorption showed similar XRD patterns, indicating MPs maintained a high crystallinity and no new crystalline phases formed. In conclusion, the input of MPs into soil might enhance the mobility of Cd via mitigating soil adsorbing capacity, thereby posing additional risks of Cd to agroecosystem.},

However, researches on their distribution and fates in farmland as well as their potential impacts on soil ecosystems are limited, especially studies on the influences of MPs on enzymes associated with carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling and microbial nutrient limitations characterized by enzymatic stoichiometry are missing. In this study, we investigated the MPs characteristics under different continuous mulching management years (3, 6, 10, 15, and 20a) of tobacco fields in Enshi Prefecture, China, and identified the mechanisms of MPs pollution on soil microbial nutrient limitations. The results showed that the abundance of MPs varied from 647 to 2840 items/kg. Films, fibers and small-sized particles (0-1.0 mm) were the predominant types and size, respectively, and increased significantly with the increase of planting years. A vector analysis of enzyme activity suggested that microbial metabolism was limited both with C and P. The correlation analysis demonstrated that MPs pollution and soil properties were significantly linked to microbial nutrient limitations. Meanwhile, partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed that MPs abundance exacerbated microbial limitation mainly by directly affecting soil microbial properties, followed by soil physical properties and soil nutrients, whereas MPs size and shapes indirectly exacerbated microbial nutrient limitation by significantly influencing MPs abundance. These results demonstrated that contamination of soil with MPs may have deleterious effects on soil key functions related to microbial metabolism, nutrient cycling, etc. Changes in soil properties and functions can damage plant growth and development, which may further affect crop yield and quality. This study provided a new theoretical basis for the response of soil microbial metabolism to MPs pollution and facilitated a better understanding and estimation of the environmental behavior and ecological risk of MPs in agricultural fields.},

In order to better understand MP behavior in soils, the sources, migration, distribution, biological effects, degradation and analytical methodology of non-biodegradable MPs in soils were quantificationally summarized from 170 publications based on Web of Science in 1950–2020. From the publications, we found these studies were mainly carried out in the Asia (60.0\%) and Europe (23.3\%), and most were on agricultural soils (68.5\%). Polyethylene-MP (78.8\% of the studies), Polypropylene-MP (78.8\%), and Polystyrene-MP (45.5\%) were the MPs most frequently found in the soils, with a MP size of 20–5000~µm being most common. Of the soil samples 64.3\% contained MP 1000–4000 items~kg-1, and the colour frequency ranking is blue (66.7\%) {$>$} white (61.1\%) ≈ red ≈ black. MPs changed the soil microenvironment and microorganism activity, and caused the negative effects on both soil animals (100\%) and plants (57.9\%). MP degradation was influenced by the photooxidation reactions, microorganism activities, enzymatic effects, environmental conditions, and by the composition, size and morphology of the MPs. An optional analytical method was suggested in this study. At the end of paper, the urgent and important research work in the future was prospected.},

Exposure values to HFRs from plastics via soil ingestion and dermal contact with soil were generally two orders of magnitude lower than those from soil.

In this study, 65 sewage sludge samples collected from sewage treatment plants (STPs) across the United States were analyzed for MPs originating from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC) using alkali-assisted thermal depolymerization and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. PET and PC were detected in all sludge samples at concentrations (dry weight) in the ranges of 28–12000 μg/g (median of 370 μg/g) and 0.70–8400 μg/g (median of 5.9 μg/g), respectively. The concentrations of PET and PC varied, depending on the treatment capacity of the STPs. The annual environmental emission of MPs through sludge disposal was estimated at 3700000 kg/year for PET and 310000 kg/year for PC. Our results provide a quantitative estimate of emission of MPs through land application of sludge.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are ubiquitous in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. To prevent further contamination, methods to determine their sources are needed. Techniques to quantify and characterize microplastics in the environment are still evolving for polymers and the additives and leachable substances embedded therein, which constitute the “chemical fingerprint” of an environmental microplastic. There is a critical need for analytical methods that yield such diagnostic information on environmental microplastics that enables identification of their composition and sources of pollution. This study reports on a novel approach for rapid fingerprinting of environmental microplastics and the screening of additives using Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART)-high resolution mass spectrometry. A variety of plastic samples were investigated, including virgin pre-production pellets, microbeads from personal care products, microplastics found in the aquatic environment, and synthetic fibers. The resulting mass spectra display ∼10,000 discrete peaks, corresponding to plastic additives released by thermal desorption and polymer degradation products generated by pyrolysis. These were used to characterize differences among plastic types, microplastic source materials, and environmental samples. Multivariate statistics and elemental composition analysis approaches were applied to analyze fingerprints from the mass spectra. This promising analytical approach is sensitive, (potentially) high-throughput, and can aid in the elucidation of possible sources of microplastics and perhaps eventually to the analysis of bulk environmental samples for plastics.},

The re-used mulching of plastic film (directly cropping on the already used plastic film) was tested compared to no-mulch and new mulching (mulching new film each year), in the grain maize, forage maize, and faba bean cropping systems. The new mulch significantly increased topsoil temperature (18.4\% above average), upper 2~m soil moisture (20.2\%), crop yield (85.8\%), above-ground biomass (63.4\%), net revenue (68.4\%), proportion of macroaggregates ({$>~$}0.25~mm) (35.7\%), mean weight diameter (MWD) (78.4\%), soil organic carbon (7.0\%), and heavy fraction organic carbon (10.3\%) in all three crop systems compared to no-mulch. Re-used mulch significantly increased topsoil temperature (11.4\% above average), moisture (13.4\%), and MWD after final crop harvest (19.1\%) in all three crop systems; and significantly increased crop yield (61.8\%) and above-ground biomass (50.3\%) in the faba bean system. However, re-used mulch had no significant effect for the grain and forage maize systems compared to no-mulch. The 2-years re-used mulch (3-years continuously mulch) had significantly lower plastic film residue (57.1\% below average) after final crop harvest in all three crop systems. Re-used mulch also produced significantly higher net revenue (13.2\%) in the faba bean system compared to new mulch. In summary, cropping faba bean, under re-used mulch, instead of new mulch, significantly reduce the usage and residue of plastic film and resulted in similar high productivity, and may become a willingly adopted practice for farmers due to the higher net revenue. This work can serve as a reference for sustainable use of plastic film mulch and has potential applications to effectively reduce plastic film usage and residue in cropland and develop sustainable agriculture, especially for cultivating faba bean and other temperature-insensitive crops in developing countries.},

Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of plastic mulch patterns and crop rotations on runoff, erosion and soil physical properties in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation treatments (broccoli–zucchini–winter wheat vs. broccoli–zucchini–fallow). The wide-plastic-mulch treatment significantly (P \&lt; 0.05) reduced runoff and soil loss compared to the narrow-plastic-mulch treatment, due to the better developed micro-basins found on the raised beds that enhanced infiltration in wide-plastic-mulch systems. Our results also indicated that inclusion of a winter wheat crop in the vegetable rotation did not alter the extent of runoff and soil loss from the vegetable field. Furthermore, we found that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion in vegetable seedling stages. There were significant correlations between soil loss and runoff volume (P \&lt; 0.01) and rainfall intensity (P \&lt; 0.01). The losses of total C, N and P were closely associated with that of the soil loss, and 82\% of TC, 57\% of TN and 75\% of TP is entrained with sediment. After growing season, furrows without plastic mulch displayed lower total porosity and macroporosity (\&gt;60 μm) that impeded infiltration in surface soil (0–5 cm). Higher water stability of soil macro-aggregates \&gt;2 mm were observed in plastic mulch ridges relative to the furrows after rain season. The results obtained in this study have practical implications for soil and water conservation in vegetable culture.},

A floatation method using distilled water was used to extract the light density microplastics from soil samples. Microplastics and impurities were identified using a heating method (3–5 s at 130 °C). The number and size of particles were determined using a camera (Leica DFC 425) connected to a microscope (Leica wild M3C, Type S, simple light, 6.4×). Quantification of the microplastics was conducted using a developed model. Results showed that the floatation method was effective in extracting microplastics from soils, with recovery rates of approximately 90\%. After being exposed to heat, the microplastics in the soil samples melted and were transformed into circular transparent particles while other impurities, such as organic matter and silicates were not changed by the heat. Regression analysis of microplastics weight and particle volume (a calculation based on image J software analysis) after heating showed the best fit (y = 1.14x + 0.46, R2 = 99\%, p b 0.001). Recovery rates based on the empirical model method were N 80\%. Results from field samples collected from North-western China prove that our method of repetitive floatation and heating can be used to extract, distinguish and quantify light density polyethylene microplastics in soils. Microplastics mass can be evaluated using the empirical model.},

In this study, the status of residual film and influential factors were investigated using the methods of farm survey in combination with questionnaires and quadrat sampling at a large number of field sites in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The results showed that the amount of film utilization increased largely and reached to 1.8×105 t in 2013. Similarly, the mulching area also substantially increased in recent decades, and reached to 2.7×105 ha in the same year. According to the current survey, 60.7\% of the sites presented a greater mulch residue than the national film residue standard (75 kg ha−1), and the maximum residual amount reached 502.2 kg ha−1 in Turpan, Xinjiang. The film thickness, the mulching time and the crop type all influenced mulch residue. The thickness of the film had significantly negative correlation with the amount of residual film (P{$<$}0.05), while the mulching years had significantly positive correlation with it (P{$<$}0.05). The total amount of residual film in Xinjiang was 3.43×105 t in 2011, which accounted for 15.3\% of the cumulative dosage of mulching. Among all the crops, the cotton fields had the largest residual amount of mulch film (158.4 kg ha−1), and also the largest contribution (2.6×105 tons) to the total amount of residual film in Xinjiang.},

In soil environments, microplastics pose a potential threat to the survival, growth, and reproduction of soil microbiota that in turn threaten the biodiversity, function, and services of terrestrial ecosystems. Meanwhile, microorganisms are sensitive to microplastics due to the adaptability to changes in substrates and soil properties. Through the metabolic and mineralization processes, microorganisms are also crucial participator to the plastic biodegradation. In this review, we present current knowledges and research results of interactions between microplastics and microorganisms (both fungi and bacteria) in soil environments and mainly discuss the following: (1) effects of microplastics on microbial habitats via changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties; (2) effects of microplastics on soil microbial communities and functions; and (3) soil microbial-mediated plastic degradation with the likely mechanisms and potential remediation strategies. We aim to analyze the mechanisms driving these interactions and subsequent ecological effects, propose future directives for the study of microplastic in soils, and provide valuable information on the plastic bioremediation in contaminated soils.},

Because of their longevity, low density, and small size, MNPs can be transported over long distances by ocean currents, river flows, and wind, resulting in worldwide distribution. In addition, MNPs have a high affinity toward organic contaminants (OCs), including endogenetic OCs known as additives or plastic monomers and exogenetic OCs that are ubiquitous in the environment. Therefore, the transport of MNPs in the environment is accompanied by the immigration of OCs via sorption/desorption, which is designated as the “Trojan-Horse effect” of MNPs in this review. The Trojan-Horse effect significantly changes the potential health risks of MNPs via altering the environmental fate and the bioavailability of OCs for living organisms. Although many investigations have been carried out to understand such effect on the accumulation of OCs by organisms, however, most of which have been limited to lab-scale marine environments with distinctly various results under the individual circumstance. Therefore, long-term studies under field environment conditions are urgently needed. In addition, multimedium investigations, i.e., water-soil-plant systems in terrestrial environments, are also critical supplementary for a comprehensive understanding of the Trojan-Horse effect of MNPs in the environment.},

While the effects of microplastics on soil physical and biological properties are presenting, it remains unclear whether the organic carbon dynamics of soil are altered by increased microplastic accumulation. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influences of different polyester microfiber (PMF 0, 0.1\% and 0.3\% of soil dry weight) and organic material (OM 0, 1\%, 2\% and 3\% of soil dry weight) addition levels on soil organic carbon and to determine the PMF distribution in aggregates from a pot experiment. After 75 days of incubation under 6 wet-dry cycles, the concentrations of soil total organic carbon did not differ significantly between the PMF (9.7~±~6.6~g~kg−1) and control (9.7~±~6.9~g~kg−1) treatments. However, PMF addition significantly reduced the organic carbon concentration in the large ({$>$}2~mm) macro-aggregates compared to the control treatment (10.6~±~4.8~g~kg−1 vs. 11.7~±~4.4~g~kg−1), but the results were opposite in the small (2–0.25~mm)macro-aggregates (10.2~±~4.9~g~kg−1 vs. 8.4~±~3.8~g~kg−1). In this study, less than 30\% of added PMFs were incorporated into soil aggregates. In addition, the abundance and average length of aggregate-associated PMF in the large (2210~±~180 particles per g aggregate and 2.08~±~0.17~mm) and small (1820~±~150 particles per g aggregate and 1.68~±~0.11~mm) macro-aggregates were significantly greater than those in the micro-aggregates (1010~±~70 particles per g aggregate and 0.72~±~0.05~mm). Our results demonstrate that the distribution of organic carbon in soil macro-aggregates is affected by PMFs addition.

  abstract = {A significant advantage of Raman spectroscopy as a noninvasive optical technique is its ability to detect subtle molecular or biochemical signatures within tissue. One of the major challenges for biomedical Raman spectroscopy is the removal of intrinsic autofluorescence background signals, which are usually a few orders of magnitude stronger than those arising from Raman scattering. A number of methods have been proposed for fluorescence background removal including excitation wavelength shifting, Fourier transformation, time gating, and simple or modified polynomial fitting. The single polynomial and the modified multi-polynomial fitting methods are relatively simple and effective, and thus are widely used in biological applications. However, their performance in real-time in vivo applications and low signal-to-noise ratio environments is sub-optimal. An improved automated algorithm for fluorescence removal has been developed based on modified multi-polynomial fitting, but with the addition of (1) a peak-removal procedure during the first iteration, and (2) a statistical method to account for signal noise effects. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves the automated rejection of the fluorescence background during real-time Raman spectroscopy and for in vivo measurements characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Results have so far been variable in terms of effects, suggesting that there is substantial context-dependency in microplastic effects in soil. To better define conditions that may affect microplastic-related impacts, we here examined effects as a function of microplastic shape and polymer type, and we tested if effects on soil properties and soil microbial activities change with incubation time. In our laboratory study, we evaluated twelve different secondary microplastics representing four microplastic shapes: fibers, films, foams and fragments; and eight polymer types: polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), polyester (PES), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyurethane (PU). We mixed the microplastics with a sandy soil (0.4 \% w/w) and incubated at 25 ℃ for 31 days. Then, we collected soil samples on the 3rd, 11th, and 31st day, and measured soil pH, respiration and four enzyme activities (acid phosphatase, β-D-glucosidase, cellobiosidase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase). Our results showed that microplastics could affect soil pH, respiration and enzymatic activities depending on microplastic shape and polymer type, effects that were altered with incubation time. Soil pH increased with foams and fragments and overall decreased in the first days of incubation and then increased. Soil respiration increased with PE foams and was affected by the incubation time, declining over time. Overall, acid phosphatase activity was not affected by shape or polymer type. β-D-glucosidase activity decreased with foams, cellobiosidase activity decreased with fibers, films and foams while N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activities decreased with fibers and fragments. Enzymatic activities fluctuated during the incubation time, except N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, which showed a declining trend with incubation time. Enzymatic activities were negatively correlated with soil pH and this relationship was less strong when microplastics were added to the soil. Our study adds to the evidence that research should embrace the complexity and diversity of microplastics, highlighting the role of microplastic shape and polymer type in influencing effects; additionally, we show that incubation time is also a parameter to consider, as effects are dynamic even in the short term.},

The results showed that film mulching warmed topsoil and increased topsoil water content. The daily mean topsoil temperature in mulched plots was 2.5–3.2°C higher than that in controls during the early growing season (sowing–emergence), the difference became less as the plant canopy grew; on some days later in the season, the difference was even negative (i.e. the topsoil temperature in mulched was lower than in control plots). Seedlings under mulching emerged 8.1–11.7 d earlier than those in controls due to the increased topsoil temperature and moisture in the early season. Mulching also prolonged the duration from seedling to maturity by 0.7–15.0 d and significantly increased plant height, leaf area index, and dry matter. Compared to non-mulched plots, yields in mulched plots increased by 33.9–92.5\% and 62.9–77.8\% in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and corresponding WUEs improved by 41.4–112.6\% and 45.9–70.6\%.

Results showed that the abundance of MPs ranged from 2.2 × 104 to 6.9 × 105 particle·kg−1, and 81.7\% of particles measured ranged from 10 to 100 μm.

The most prevalent form of MP particles was fragments (53\%), followed by fiber (15.2\%). Polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, and polyvinyl chloride were commonly found at each sampling site, with polyethylene as the dominant form (36.1\%). It was inferred that industrial production activities, litter, and sewage sludge might be the main sources of the MPs pollution. Moreover, MP particles in the soil environment contained different levels of heavy metals, including Cd, Cr, Pb, Ag, Cu, Sb, Hg, Fe, and Mn. The concentration of heavy metals in MPs, particularly Cd, Pb, Mn, and Hg, was closely related to the extent of heavy metal contamination in the soil environment, inferring that MPs in the soil can be vectors for transporting heavy metals. The synergistic effect of MPs and heavy metals might pose greater risks to soil organisms and soil safety.},

  abstract = {The contamination of micro- and nanoplastics in marine systems and freshwater is a global issue. Determination of micro- and nanoplastics in the aqueous environment is of high priority to fully assess the risk that plastic particles will pose. Although microplastics have been detected in a variety of aquatic ecosystems, the analysis of nanoplastics remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, for the first time, a Triton X-45 (TX-45)-based cloud-point extraction (CPE) was proposed to preconcentrate trace nanoplastics in environmental waters. Under the optimum extraction conditions, an enrichment factor of 500 was obtained for two types of nanoplastics with different compositions, polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), without disturbing their original morphology and sizes. Additionally, following thermal treatment at 190 °C for 3 h, the CPE-obtained extract could be submitted to pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis for mass quantification of nanoplastics. Taking 66.2 nm PS nanoplastics and 86.2 nm PMMA nanoplastics as examples, the proposed method showed excellent reproducibility, and high sensitivity with respective detection limits of 11.5 and 2.5 fM. Feasibility of the proposed approach was verified by application of the optimized procedure to four real water samples. Recoveries of 84.6–96.6\% at a spiked level of 88.6 fM for PS nanoplastics and 76.5–96.6\% at a spiked level of 50.4 fM for PMMA nanoplastics were obtained. Consequently, this work provides an efficient approach for nanoplastic analysis in environmental waters.},

Investigations on microplastics pollution in coastal and marine environments have increased recently but knowledge gaps still exist regarding microplastics in coastal beach soils with high-intensity human activities. In the present study a total of 120 soil samples were taken from 53 sites along {$>$}3000 km of coastline in Shandong province, east China, adjacent to both the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea coastlines under different land use management. Microplastics were separated from the soil samples using a continuous flow and floating separation apparatus. The shape type, size, abundance, spatial distribution, polymer composition and surface morphology of the microplastics were identified by a range of advanced microscopic and micro-analytical methods. The analytical results show that seven shape types, namely foams, pellets, fragments, flakes, fibers, films and sponges, were present in the beach soils. The polymer composition of the microplastics included polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyether urethane and a polymer blend of both polyethylene and polypropylene. Approximately 60\% of the observed microplastics had a size range {$<$} 1 mm. Microplastic abundance varied greatly among the soils, ranging from 1.3 to 14,712.5 N kg−1 (dry weight) as influenced by high-intensity human activities such as mariculture, tourism, and port construction. The seven shape types of microplastics from the coastal environment had different weathering surface morphologies, showing scratches, creases, micropores, cracks, either concave or convex, and of various shapes and sizes, possibly due to physical friction, photochemical oxidation and/or animal attack. Algae or crude oil was observed on the surface of some microplastics. The weathered surfaces of microplastics might act as a high-capacity carrier with adhering microorganisms and chemicals. Further studies are required on the weathering processes, sorption capacity and transport of microplastics especially in smaller size ({$<$}1 mm) under coastal conditions.},

  abstract = {Plastic film mulching is an effective practice to improve water harvest and crop productivity in semiarid areas. The grain yield of maize (Zea mayis) as affected by various mulching practices was studied in the field in 2006 and 2007 to determine a mulching pattern that would increase rainwater harvest and crop yield. In 2006, three treatments were used: (1) flat plot without mulch (CK); (2) two ridges and furrows mulched by one plastic film and maize planted in the furrow between the two ridges (DRM); (3) two rows of maize planted in a ridged bed mulched with plastic (RM). Two additional treatments were tested in 2007: (4) two rows of maize mulched with a 70-cm wide plastic film and then 30 cm of bare soil alternated (NM); (5) maize planted without ridges in double rows 80 cm apart and the whole plot mulched with plastic film (WM). Maize yield was highest in the DRM treatment: 1150 kg ha−1 in 2006 and 6130 kg ha−1 in 2007. This was associated with better topsoil moisture in the planting zone and higher soil temperature in the DRM treatment compared with the other treatments. The soil moisture in DRM reached 10.5\% and 22.6\%, in 2006 and 2007, respectively, the highest of all the treatments. The mean temperature in DRM was higher than in CK and RM by 1.2 °C and 0.4 °C, respectively in 2006, while in 2007, it was higher than that in CK by 3.1 °C, in RM by 0.6 °C, in NM by1.7 °C and in WM by 0.6 °C in 2007. The higher temperatures in the DRM treatments resulted in the maize maturing earlier than in the other mulched treatments, 15 days earlier than in RM in 2006 and 11 days, 3 days, and 14 days earlier than in RM, WM, and NM, respectively in 2007. The highest water-use efficiency (WUE) was found in DRM in both years. In 2006, the WUE in DRM was six times greater than that in CK and 9.96\% greater than in RM. In 2007, the WUE for grain in the DRM treatment was 16.6 kg ha−1 mm−1, 11 times greater than that in CK and greater than RM, NM and WM by 67.7\%, 26.7\% and 9.2\%, respectively. It is concluded that the double ridges and furrow mulching treatment could serve as a model for maize production for small-holder farmers in semiarid regions.},

The study was conducted in a typical semiarid area, during the four annual growing seasons of 2005–2008 and five treatments were designed: (1) a flat plot with no mulching, which is the conventional tillage practice (CK); (2) alternating ridges and furrows with no mulching (M0C0); (3) alternating ridges and furrows with no mulching, and subgrooves mulched with plastic film (M0C); (4) alternating ridges and furrows, with only the ridges mulched with plastic film on the surface (MC0); and (5) alternating ridges and furrows, as well as subgrooves, with the ridges and subgrooves mulched with plastic film (MC). The subgrooves with plastic film mulching increased topsoil temperature, the average daily soil temperature of the 4-growing seasons was 16.7, 16.8, 16.9, 17.4 and 17.2 °C for the CK, M0C0, MC0, M0C and MC, respectively. The soil temperature was significantly higher in the M0C and MC than in the CK, M0C0 and MC0 in May 2006, September in 2007 and May 2008. In average and wet years, the soil water content in the 20–40 cm soil layer was 6.2–37.7\% higher in the MC than in the CK. The ridges and subgrooves with plastic film mulching improved crop yields, and the average yield over the four years was higher in the MC than in the CK, M0C0, M0C and MC0 by 163\%, 98\%, 62\% and 21\%, respectively. Potato is a staple and economic crop in this region, and the ratio of large and moderate-sized potato tuber yield to total tuber yield was 21.7\% higher in the treatments with subgrooves than in the treatments without subgrooves. In conclusion, the technique of ridges and subgrooves with plastic film mulching is an effective practice for improving crop yields in semiarid agroecosystems.},

Sixty soil samples covering mulching and no-mulching farmlands, and forty-five irrigation water samples were collected for analysis. Microplastics were obtained from the soils using continuous air flotation followed by density separation. Stereomicroscopy and micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (μ-FTIR) were used for identification. Mulching soils contained larger amounts of microplastics than non-mulching soils, with 571 pieces kg−1 and 263 pieces kg−1, respectively, on average. The abundances of films and fibers were significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) higher in the mulching soils. Microplastics in the soils and waters were dominated by fragments and fibers, respectively. The particle size of the microplastics in soils mostly ranged from 1 to 3\,mm, and primarily from 90\,μm to 1\,mm in waters. Multiple polymers, e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, rayon, acrylic and polyamide, and shapes found in the soil microplastics indicate contributions from irrigation and plastic waste residues other than plastic mulching. Future studies might include the long-term accumulation of microplastics in agroecosystems from multiple sources under intensively managed cropping systems.},

  abstract = {Plastics accumulating in the environment, especially microplastics (defined as particles {$<$}5~mm), can lead to a range of problems and potential loss of ecosystem services. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable plastics used in mulch films, and in packaging material to minimize plastic waste and to reduce soil pollution. Little is known, however, about the effect of microbioplastics on soil-plant interactions, especially soil microbial community structure and functioning in agroecosystems. For the first time, we combined zymography (to localize enzyme activity hotspots) with substrate-induced growth respiration to investigate the effect of PHAs addition on soil microbial community structure, growth, and exoenzyme kinetics in the microplastisphere (i.e. interface between soil and microplastic particles) compared to the rhizosphere and bulk soil. We used a common PHAs biopolymer, poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and showed that PHBV was readily used by the microbial community as a source of carbon (C) resulting in an increased specific microbial growth rate and a more active microbial biomass in the microplastisphere in comparison to the bulk soil. Higher β-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase activities (0.6–5.0 times higher Vmax) and lower enzyme affinities (1.5–2.0 times higher Km) were also detected in the microplastisphere relative to the rhizosphere. Furthermore, the PHBV addition changed the soil bacterial community at different taxonomical levels and increased the alpha diversity, as well as the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia phyla, compared to the untreated soils. Overall, PHBV addition created soil hotspots where C and nutrient turnover is greatly enhanced, mainly driven by the accelerated microbial biomass and activity. In conclusion, microbioplastics have the potential to alter soil ecological functioning and biogeochemical cycling (e.g., SOM decomposition).},

  abstract = {Understanding plant–soil relationships may help maximize crop productivity while maintaining and improving soil quality. Field experiments were conducted in 2006 and 2007 at the Dryland Agricultural Experimental Station of the Loess Plateau, Lanzhou University, China, to determine the effects of various ridge-furrow and plastic-mulching techniques on the growth and yield of maize (Zea mays L.) and soil biochemical properties. Five treatments were designed: (1) flat-plot sowing without ridge-furrow mulching (CK), (2) large (80 cm) and small (40 cm) ridges alternated and fully mulched with plastic (DRM), (3) on-furrow sowing with plastic mulch applied only on the ridge at a row spacing of 60 cm and 40 cm alternatively (RM), (4) flat-plot sowing with plastic mulch at a row spacing of 60 cm and 40 cm alternatively (NM), and (5) flat-plot sowing with plastic mulch at a row spacing of 80 cm and 40 cm alternatively (WM). The results showed that film mulching enhanced soil microbial biomass; where microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in the DRM treatment reached 633 mg kg−1 at harvest in 2007, three times the MBC of the CK. The MBC:SOC ratios were 8.8\%, 7.1\%, 5.7\% and 5.4\% in DRM, RM, NM and WM, respectively. The ridge-furrow with plastic-mulching increased soil light fraction carbon (LFOC) in both years, averaging up to 1.04 g kg−1 at harvest. Underground plant biomass increased substantially in the mulching treatments, especially in DRM. Positive correlations were found between total biomass and LFOC, between MBC and LFOC, and between MBC and available phosphorus (AP), but a negative correlation between SOC and soil mineral nitrogen (MN). The carbon to phosphorus (C/P) ratio was highest in DRM among treatments, but the content of SOC, MN, and C/N ratio in DRM was lowest, suggesting that the DRM treatment strengthened the interactions between maize and soil, and that the increased content of LFOC with time provides a basis for increasing productivity in future years. In conclusion, the ridge-furrow and plastic-mulching technique brought about a challenge in maintaining soil fertility, but this technology provides a potential opportunity of substantially increasing crop yields in semiarid rainfed regions.},

Unfortunately, their small size and the presence of different dyes on the microfibers themselves cause difficulties in identification via conventional spectroscopic methods of total attenuated resonance–Fourier transform infrared and Raman. To help solve some of these methodological challenges, we developed a new method employing polymer–dye binding chemistry, density tests, unique surface morphological traits, and fluorescent staining to identify microfibers in environmental samples. The identification method introduced here was tested in our laboratory via trials using microfibers shed from new textiles and environmental samples. We found that the method can be successfully applied to identify the different polymer types of microfibers, which can ultimately help source apportion microfiber contamination in the environment.},

Gravel and plastic film mulching are effective methods for improving agricultural productivity and water utilization. However, the effects of these mulching practices on soil water supply and plant water use associated with crop yield are not well understood. A 3-yr study was conducted to analyze the occurrence and distribution of dry spells in a semiarid region of Northwest China and to evaluate the effects of non-mulching (CK), gravel mulching (GM) and plastic film mulching (FM) on the soil water supply, plant water use and maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield. Rainfall analysis showed that dry spells of ≥5 days occurred frequently in each of 3 yr, accounting for 59.9–69.2\% of the maize growing periods. The \&gt;15-d dry spells during the jointing stage would expose maize plants to particularly severe water stress. Compared with the CK treatment, both the GM and FM treatments markedly increased soil water storage during the early growing season. In general, the total evapotranspiration (ET) was not significantly different among the three treatments, but the mulched treatments significantly increased the ratio of pre- to post-silking ET, which was closely associated with yield improvement. As a result, the grain yield significantly increased by 17.1, 70.3 and 16.7\% for the GM treatment and by 28.3, 87.6 and 38.2\% for the FM treatment in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, compared with the CK treatment. It's concluded that both GM and FM are effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of water deficit and improving maize production in semiarid areas. However, FM is more effective than GM.},

  abstract = {Although the roles of earthworms and soil collembolans in the transport of microplastics have been studied previously, the effects of the soil biota at different trophic levels and interspecific relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we examine three soil microarthropod species to explore their effects on the transport of microplastics. The selected Folsomia candida and Hypoaspis aculeifer are extensively used model organisms, and Damaeus exspinosus is a common and abundant indigenous species in China. A model food chain (prey-collembolan and predator-mite) was structured to test the role of the predator-prey relationship in the transport of microplastics. Commercial Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles (Diameter: 80–250 μm) were selected as the test microplastics, because large amounts of PVC have persisted and accumulated in the environment. Synchronized soil microarthropods were held in plates for seven days to determine the movement of microplastics. The 5000 microplastic particles were carefully placed in the center of each plate prior to the introduction of the animals. Our results clearly show that all three microarthropod species moved and dispersed the microplastics in the plates. The 0.54\%, 1.8\% and 4.6\% of the added microplastic particles were moved by collembolan, predatory mite and oribatid mite, respectively. Soil microarthropods ({$<$}0.2 cm) transported microplastic particles up to 9 cm. The avoidance behavior was observed in the collembolans in respect of the microplastics. The predatory -prey relationship did promote the transport of microplastics in the plates, increasing transport by 40\% compared with the effects of adding single species (P {$<$} .05). Soil microarthropods commonly occur in surface soils (0–5 cm) and, due to their small body size, they can enter soil pores. Our results therefore suggest that the movement of microplastics by soil microarthropods may influence the exposure of other soil biota to microplastics and change the physical properties of soils.},

  abstract = {Although a growing number of studies have reported microplastics (MPs) in biosolids and soils, there are significant differences in the concentrations found across different regions worldwide. This has raised questions about the quality of studies due to a lack of standardized sampling and analysis methods for detecting MPs in such complex samples. In this study, we applied a systematic quantitative literature review (SQLR) methodology to analyze studies reporting MPs in sludge/biosolids and agricultural soils. We also assessed the quality of individual studies on MPs in sludge/biosolids and soils based on the inclusion of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures. There is limited understanding about MPs in soils with a history of biosolid application with only 9\% of publications reporting MPs in biosolid-amended soil. There was almost eight orders of magnitude difference (3.4~×~10−5 to 9.4~×~103 particles/g) between the highest concentrations of MPs in sludge/biosolid samples compared to the lowest virgin soil samples. The literature shows a consistency in the polymer types (polyester, PP and PE) and morphotypes (fibres and fragments) of MPs most frequently detected in biosolids and soils, suggesting a potential role of biosolids in soils MP pollution. Despite the large variations in the sizes of MPs, there was a negative correlation between the lowest size detected and concentrations reported. This indicates that current concentrations of MPs are influenced by the detection size. Our assessment shows that the majority of studies to-date lack critical QA/QC measures, particularly field blank, positive control and method validation. This highlights an urgent need for quality improvement of future research in this field to produce reliable data, ultimately crucial to assess the risk of MPs and derive suitable environmental guidelines. It is recommended that MPs studies methodically include QA/QC protocols at every step of the process to ensure the integrity of the data that is published.},

  abstract = {Wastewater effluent is expected to be a pathway for microplastics to enter the aquatic environment, with microbeads from cosmetic products and polymer fibres from clothes likely to enter wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). To date, few studies have quantified microplastics in wastewater. Moreover, the lack of a standardized and applicable method to identify microplastics in complex samples, such as wastewater, has limited the accurate assessment of microplastics and may lead to an incorrect estimation. This study aimed to develop a validated method to sample and process microplastics from wastewater effluent and to apply the developed method to quantify and characterise wastewater-based microplastics in effluent from three WWTPs that use primary, secondary and tertiary treatment processes. We applied a high-volume sampling device that fractionated microplastics in situ and an efficient sample processing procedure to improve the sampling of microplastics in wastewater and to minimize the false detection of non-plastic particles. The sampling device captured between 92\% and 99\% of polystyrene microplastics using 25~μm–500~μm mesh screens in laboratory tests. Microplastic type, size and suspected origin in all studied WWTPs, along with the removal efficiency during the secondary and tertiary treatment stages, was investigated. Suspected microplastics were characterised using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, with between 22 and 90\% of the suspected microplastics found to be non-plastic particles. An average of 0.28, 0.48 and 1.54 microplastics per litre of final effluent was found in tertiary, secondary and primary treated effluent, respectively. This study suggests that although low concentrations of microplastics are detected in wastewater effluent, WWTPs still have the potential to act as a pathway to release microplastics given the large volumes of effluent discharged to the aquatic environment. This study focused on a single sampling campaign, with long-term monitoring recommended to further characterise microplastics in wastewater.},

  abstract = {The Munich Plastic Sediment Separator (MPSS), proposed by Imhof et al. (), showed its high efficiency in extracting microplastics (MPs) from natural sediment samples preliminarily cleaned and then enriched by MPs in laboratory. We tested the efficiency of the MPSS, assembled at the Atlantic Branch of P.P.Shirshov Institute of Oceanology (Kaliningrad), using unprepared natural bottom deposits of different types collected in the Baltic Sea. The tests that were performed included spikes of sediments with artificial reference particles (ARPs) and the sediment samples analyses with two separate methods of extraction and determination of MPs content in residuals of MPSS. While the ARP extraction efficiency from natural sediments by the MPSS was really high (97.1\% ± 2.6\%; p = 0.05; n = 14; confidence interval, t-distribution), the extraction efficiency of marine MPs was considerably lower (13–39\%) than that obtained with a modification of the method previously published by NOAA. The remaining marine MPs were found in the spoil dump and in the bulk solution fractions of the separator, indicating that MPs were not perfectly cleaned from sediment particles, probably, due to presence of organic matter. It is concluded that the MPSS application for quantitative MPs analysis requires further testing and elaboration of standardized extraction procedures.},

Our objectives were to evaluate the interaction between fertilisation rates and irrigation treatments, and to quantify nitrate leaching in a plastic mulched/drip irrigated zucchini squash production systems. Three studies were carried out. The first study evaluated different depth placement of drip and fertigation lines on plant growth and fruit yield. Treatments included SUR (both irrigation and fertigation drip lines placed on the surface); S\&amp;S (both lines buried 0.15 m deep); and SDI (irrigation line placed 0.15 m below the fertigation line on the surface). The second and third studies compared three different N-rates and different soil moisture sensor-based irrigation strategies. Nitrate-N leaching was monitored by zero tension drainage lysimeters and soil samples. N leaching increased when irrigation and N-rates increased, with values ranging from 2 to 45 kg ha−1 of N. Use of SDI increased yields by 16\% compared to the S\&amp;S treatment, and reduced nitrate leaching by 93\% while increasing the water use efficiency by 75\% compared to a fixed 2-h irrigation event per day treatment. Application of N above the standard recommended rate of 145 kg ha−1 did not increase yield, although yields were reduced at the lowest N-rate. The use of soil moisture sensors for automatic irrigation control reduced irrigation application and minimized nitrogen leaching. In addition, combining the soil moisture controlled SDI system that had surface applied fertigation resulted in similar or higher yields, while reducing both water use and potential N leaching because of improved nutrient retention in the root zone.},

  abstract = {Soil evaporation is an important component of the water balance in irrigated agriculture. Mulching can be an effective technique to reduce soil evaporation but its efficiency depends on meteorological conditions and the characteristics of the different mulching materials. The objective of this work was to assess the effectiveness of inorganic (plastic) and organic (pine bark, vine pruning residues, geotextile, and wheat straw) mulching materials for soil evaporation control during the energy-limited and falling-rate evaporation stages. Soil evaporation rates (ER) were quantified through consecutive weighings of initially wet soils placed in trays in the laboratory and in microlysimeters in the field. ER depended on meteorological and experimental conditions, stage of evaporation and type of mulching material. In the falling-rate stage, ERs decreased linearly (p \&lt; 0.001) with decreases in GWC, and for long drying periods the ERs were low and similar among treatments, implying that soil mulching will be ineffective for soil evaporation control in low-frequency irrigation systems. In the energy-limited stage, all mulching materials decreased the ERs in relation to the bare soil, but the plastic, vine residues and pine bark materials had lower ERs than the rest of mulching materials. These materials will be therefore recommended for soil evaporation control in high-frequency irrigation systems where the soil surface remains wet most of the time.},

Synthetic fiber delectability was examined in sludges (dewatered, pelletized, composted, alkaline-stabilized) and in soils from experimental columns and field sites applied with those sludge products. Fibers (isolated by water extraction and examined using polarized light microscopy) were detectable in sludge products and in soil columns over 5 years after application, retaining characteristics observed in the applied sludge. Concentrations mirrored (within a factor of 2) predictions based on soil dilution. Fibers were detectable in field site soils up to 15 years after application, again retaining the characteristics seen in sludge products. Concentrations correlated with residual sludge metal concentration gradients in a well-characterized field site. Fibers found along preferential flow paths and/or in horizons largely below the mixed layer suggest some potential for translocation. Synthetic fibers were shown to be rapid and semi-quantitative indicators of past sludge application. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We present a novel approach that allows tracking of carbon from biodegradable polymers into CO2 and microbial biomass. The approach is based on 13C-labeled polymers and on isotope-specific analytical methods, including nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Our results unequivocally demonstrate the biodegradability of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), an important polyester used in agriculture, in soil. Carbon from each monomer unit of PBAT was used by soil microorganisms, including filamentous fungi, to gain energy and to form biomass. This work advances both our conceptual understanding of polymer biodegradation and the methodological capabilities to assess this process in natural and engineered environments. Stable isotope labeling of agricultural polyesters enables demonstration of their microbial utilization in soils.
