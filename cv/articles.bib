  abstract = {Aflatoxins (AFs) are toxic fungal secondary metabolites that are commonly detected in food commodities. Currently, there is a lack of generic methods capable of determining AFs both at postharvest stages in agricultural products and preharvest stages, namely, the agricultural soil. Here, we present a simple and reliable method for quantitative analysis of AFs in soil and food matrices at environmentally relevant concentrations for the first time, using the same extraction procedure and chromatography, either by HPLC-FLD or LC–MS. AFs were extracted from matrices by ultrasonication using an acetonitrile/water mixture (84:16, v + v) without extensive and time-consuming cleanup procedures. Food extracts were defatted with n-hexane. Matrix effects in terms of signal suppression/enhancement (SSE) for HPLC-FLD were within ±20\% for all matrices tested. For LC–MS, the SSE values were mostly within ±20\% for soil matrices but outside ±20\% for all food matrices. The sensitivity of the method allowed quantitative analysis even at trace levels with quantification limits (LOQs) between 0.04 and 0.23 μg kg–1 for HPLC-FLD and 0.06–0.23 μg kg–1 for LC–MS. The recoveries ranged from 64 to 92, 74 to 101, and 78 to 103\% for fortification levels of 0.5, 5, and 20 μg kg–1, respectively, with repeatability values of 2–18\%. The validation results are in accordance with the quality criteria and limits for mycotoxins set by the European Commission, thus confirming a satisfactory performance of the analytical method. Although reliable analysis is possible with both instruments, the HPLC-FLD method may be more suitable for routine analysis because it does not require consideration of the matrix.},

  abstract = {Phenolic compounds occur in a variety of plants and can be used as model compounds for investigating the fate of organic wastewater, lignin, or soil organic matter in the environment. The aim of this study was to better understand and differentiate mechanisms associated with photo- and biodegradation of tyrosol, vanillin, vanillic acid, and coumaric acid in soil. In a 29 d incubation experiment, soil spiked with these phenolic compounds was either subjected to UV irradiation under sterile conditions or to the native soil microbial community in the dark. Changes in the isotopic composition (δ13C) of phenolic compounds were determined by gas chromatography–isotope ratio mass spectrometry and complemented by concentration measurements. Phospholipid-derived fatty acid and ergosterol biomarkers together with soil water repellency measurements provided information on soil microbial and physical properties. Biodegradation followed pseudo-first-order dissipation kinetics, enriched remaining phenolic compounds in 13C, and was associated with increased fungal rather than bacterial biomarkers. Growing mycelia rendered the soil slightly water repellent. High sample variation limited the reliable estimation of apparent kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs) to tyrosol. The AKIE of tyrosol biodegradation was 1.007 ± 0.002. Photooxidation kinetics were of pseudo-zero- or first-order with an AKIE of 1.02 ± 0.01 for tyrosol, suggesting a hydroxyl-radical mediated degradation process. Further research needs to address δ13C variation among sample replicates potentially originating from heterogeneous reaction spaces in soil. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance or nanoscopic imaging could help to better understand the distribution of organic compounds and their transformation in the soil matrix.},

  abstract = {PurposeParticularly in organic viticulture, copper compounds are intentionally released into the environment as fungicide, whereas uranium originates from conventional phosphate fertilization. Both activities contribute to the metal contamination in wine-growing areas. This pilot study aimed to better understand how soil properties influence the presence and environmental fate of copper and uranium with respect to viticultural management.Materials and methodsWe characterized metal binding forms, i.e., their association with different soil constituents, in organically and conventionally cultivated vineyard soils and adjacent upstream and downstream sediments. The available metal fraction and the fractions associated with manganese oxides, organic matter, iron oxides, and total contents were extracted sequentially.Results and discussionTotal soil copper ranged from 200 to 1600 mg kg−1 with higher contents in topsoil than subsoil. The majority of copper (42–82\%) was bound to soil organic matter. In all fractions, copper contents were up to 2-fold higher in organic than in conventional vineyards, whereas the sediment concentrations were independent of the adjacent viticultural management. A net increase of copper in downstream sediments was found only when water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in an adjacent vineyard was elevated. With 11 ± 1 mg kg−1, total uranium was 25\% higher in conventional than in organic vineyard soils. Its affinity to iron or WEOC potentially rendered uranium mobile leading to a substantial discharge to downstream sediments.ConclusionsTranslocation of copper and uranium from vineyards into adjacent stream sediments may rather be attributed to WEOC and iron contents than the viticultural management. Follow-up studies should scrutinize the processes driving metal availability and transport as well as their interaction at the aquatic–terrestrial interface.},

  abstract = {Olive oil production generates large amounts of olive mill wastewater (OMW). OMW has a high nutrient content and could serve as fertilizer, but its fatty and phenolic constituents induce soil water repellency, phytotoxicity, and acidification. An appropriate season of OMW application may mitigate negative consequences while preserving beneficial effects. In order to investigate this, a field study was conducted, in which OMW was applied to an olive orchard in Israel either in winter or summer. Soil–water interactions (water drop penetration time, hydraulic conductivity), soil physicochemical parameters, phenolic compounds, and soil biological activity (bait-lamina test) were determined 12 to 18\,months after OMW application. The results showed elevated K+ contents in all treatments, but all other soil properties of winter treatments were comparable to the control, which suggested a certain recovery potential of the soil when OMW is applied in winter. By contrast, summer treatments revealed a ten-fold higher soil water repellency, a three-times lower biological activity, and a four-fold higher content of phenolic compounds, independently of whether the soil was kept moist by irrigation or not. Thus, the OMW constituents were neither degraded nor leached by winter rain when applied during the hot season. Further research is needed to distinguish leaching and biodegradation effects, and to understand the development of the composition and degradation kinetics of organic OMW constituents.},
